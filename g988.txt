Recommendation ITU-T G.984.4
                    Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Networks (G-PON):
                   ONT management and control interface specification
Summary
Recommendation ITU-T G.984.4 provides the optical network termination (ONT) management and
control interface (OMCI) specification for gigabit-capable passive optical network (G-PON) systems
as defined in Recommendations ITU-T G.984.2 and G.984.3.
Firstly, it specifies the managed entities of a protocol-independent management information base
(MIB) that models the exchange of information between the optical line termination (OLT) and the
optical network termination (ONT). In addition, it covers the ONT management and control channel,
protocol and detailed messages. This revised version incorporates the material from Amendment 1
(2005), Amendment 2 (2006), and Amendment 3 (2006).
In addition to the purely editorial collection work, this revision endeavours to remove all references
to the optional ATM transport capabilities of G-PON, since all modern systems do not support it.

Recommendation ITU-T G.984.4 was approved on 22 February 2008 by ITU-T Study Group 15
(2005-2008) under Recommendation ITU-T A.8 procedure.
This edition includes additions and corrections approved on 29 March 2008 by ITU-T
Study Group 15 (2005-2008) under the Recommendation ITU-T A.8 procedure.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the United Nations specialized agency in the field of
telecommunications, information and communication technologies (ICTs). The ITU Telecommunication
Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical,
operating and tariff questions and issuing Recommendations on them with a view to standardizing
telecommunications on a worldwide basis.
The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years,
establishes the topics for study by the ITU-T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on
these topics.
The approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1.
In some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T's purview, the necessary standards are
prepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC.
                                                      NOTE
In this Recommendation, the expression "Administration" is used for conciseness to indicate both a
telecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency.
Compliance with this Recommendation is voluntary. However, the Recommendation may contain certain
mandatory provisions (to ensure e.g. interoperability or applicability) and compliance with the
Recommendation is achieved when all of these mandatory provisions are met. The words "shall" or some
other obligatory language such as "must" and the negative equivalents are used to express requirements. The
use of such words does not suggest that compliance with the Recommendation is required of any party.
                                   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
ITU draws attention to the possibility that the practice or implementation of this Recommendation may
involve the use of a claimed Intellectual Property Right. ITU takes no position concerning the evidence,
validity or applicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others
outside of the Recommendation development process.
As of the date of approval of this Recommendation, ITU had received notice of intellectual property,
protected by patents, which may be required to implement this Recommendation. However, implementers
are cautioned that this may not represent the latest information and are therefore strongly urged to consult the
TSB patent database at http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/.

Recommendation ITU-T G.984.4
                   Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Networks (G-PON):
                  ONT management and control interface specification
1        Scope
This Recommendation specifies the optical network termination management and control interface
(OMCI) for the G-PON system defined in [ITU-T G.984.2] and [ITU-T G.984.3] to enable multi-
vendor interoperability between the optical line termination (OLT) and the ONT.
The OMCI specification addresses the ONT configuration management, fault management and
performance management for G-PON system operation and for several services, including:
•        asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) adaptation layer 5;
•        G-PON encapsulation method (GEM) adaptation layers;
•        circuit emulation service;
•        Ethernet services, including MAC bridged LAN;
•        voice services;
•        wavelength division multiplexing.
The focus of this OMCI specification is on Fibre to the home (FTTH) and Fibre to the business
(FTTBusiness) ONTs; however, support for optical network units (ONUs) is addressed as well.
This Recommendation defines a protocol necessary to support the capabilities identified for these
ONTs. It also allows optional components and future extensions.

3        Definitions
This Recommendation defines the following terms:
3.1      downstream: Downstream is a traffic flow from OLT to ONT.
3.2      optical network termination (ONT): A single subscriber device that terminates any one of
the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an ODN, implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to
subscriber service interfaces. An ONT is a special case of an ONU.
3.3      optical network unit (ONU): A generic term denoting a device that terminates any one of
the distributed (leaf) endpoints of an ODN, implements a PON protocol, and adapts PON PDUs to
subscriber service interfaces. In some contexts, an ONU implies a multiple subscriber device.
NOTE – This Recommendation uses the term ONT to refer to either configuration unless a distinction is
necessary.
3.4      upstream: The upstream is a traffic flow from ONT to OLT.

5         Conventions
In all bit vectors indicated in this Recommendation, the rightmost bit is bit 1. This represents the
least significant bit, while bit 8 represents the most significant bit within a byte. If the bit vector is
made up of more than one byte, then the numbering starts from the least significant byte onwards.
In all attribute descriptions that refer to the Boolean values "true" and "false," true is coded as 0x01
in hexadecimal and false is coded as 0.
attribute.
"ASCII string" is a sequence of ASCII encoded characters, terminated by the NULL character
(0x00). If a string occupies the entire allocated size of an attribute, the terminating null is not
required.
6         Reference model and terms
6.1       OMCI in Recommendation ITU-T G.984.1
The network architecture reference model for G-PON is described in [b-ITU-T G.984.1] and shown
in Figure 6.1-1. The G-PON fits various access network architectures, e.g., FTTH, FTTB/C and
FTTCab.
The OMCI specification fits into the overall [b-ITU-T G.984.1] model for an access network system
as illustrated in Figure 6.1-1. The dotted line shows a path for OMCI signals between an OLT and
ONT.
                                     Figure 6.1-1 − Reference model
6.2       ONT functions
As shown in Figure 6.2-1, the functions of the ONT are:
a)        access network line termination function (AN-LT);
b)        user network interface line termination function (UNI-LT), noting that in the fibre to the
          business case the UNIs from one ONT may belong to different users;
c)        service multiplexing and de-multiplexing function (service MUX and DEMUX).
                           Figure 6.2-1 – ONT functional block diagram
6.3      Encapsulation in GEM frame
As the GEM is embedded in the PON section, it is independent of the types of UNIs. The UNI
traffic is always encapsulated in GEM frames so that a cross-connect function is not needed in
GEM service.
6.4      Support of multicast connection
Multicast traffic can be supported in a G-PON network. While a port-ID is assigned to a single UNI
in a unicast connection, a port-ID is shared by multiple UNIs in multiple ONTs in a multicast
connection. The multicast connection set-up process is the same as the unicast connection set-up
process. It is the responsibility of the OLT to manage the members of a multicast group and control
the multicast connection in ONTs.
In the downstream direction, a multicast connection is useful for bandwidth savings. On the other
hand, in the upstream direction, it is impossible to support the multicast connection with a shared
port-ID because the OLT cannot reassemble segmented GEM packets correctly when it receives
several GEM packets with same port-ID from different ONTs. Therefore, upstream traffic
associated with a multicast service must be sent to the OLT over a separate unicast connection.
6.5      Voice over IP management
While OMCI is always used to manage PON services and ONT equipment, VoIP services may
optionally be managed by means external to OMCI. This allows operators more flexibility in
choosing how to manage their overall VoIP service regardless of the access technology involved.
VoIP service on an ONT may be managed via one of two paths:
1)       OMCI path – OMCI has full view and control of all VoIP service attributes.
2)       IP path – OMCI is only used to configure attributes that allow non-OMCI based control of
         VoIP service attributes.
Specifically, if the OMCI path is used to manage a VoIP service, all of the managed entities defined
here may be read and/or written.
If the IP path is used to manage a SIP VoIP service, only the following MEs may be read and/or
written with respect to the VoIP service (all other MEs are unaffected, of course):
•        IP host config data;
•        IP host PM history data;
•        VoIP config data;
•        PPTP POTS UNI;
•        Call control PM history data;
•        RTP PM history data;
•        SIP call initiation PM history data;
•        SIP agent PM history data;
•        SIP config portal;
•        VoIP line status.
If the IP path is used to manage a H.248 VoIP service, only the following MEs may be read and/or
written with respect to the VoIP service (all other MEs are unaffected, of course):
•        IP host config data;
•        IP host PM history data;
•        VoIP config data;
•        PPTP POTS UNI;
•        Call control PM history data;
•        RTP PM history data;
•        MGC PM history data;
•        H.248 config portal;
•        VoIP line status.
7        Requirements of the management interface specification
The OMCI is used by the OLT to control an ONT. This protocol allows the OLT to:
a)       establish and release connections across the ONT;
b)       manage the UNIs at the ONT;
c)       request configuration information and performance statistics;
d)       autonomously inform the system operator of events such as link failures.
The OMCI protocol runs across a GEM connection between the OLT controller and the ONT
controller that is established at ONT initialization (note that the option of using an ATM connection
for OMCI is deprecated). The OMCI protocol is asymmetric: the controller in the OLT is the master
and the one in the ONT is the slave. A single OLT controller using multiple instances of the
protocol over separate control channels may control multiple ONTs.
The ONT management and control interface requirements given in this Recommendation are
needed to manage the ONT in the following areas:
a)       configuration management;
b)       fault management;
c)       performance management;
d)       security management.
7.1      Configuration management
Configuration management provides functions to exercise control over, identify, collect data from
and provide data to the ONT. This involves the following:
a)       configuration of equipment;
b)       configuration of the UNIs;
c)       configuration of the GEM port network CTPs;
d)       configuration of interworking termination points;
e)        configuration of the OAM flows;
f)        configuration of the physical ports;
g)        configuration of GAL profiles;
h)        configuration of service profiles;
i)        configuration of traffic descriptors;
j)        configuration of AAL profile, in a limited sense.
All ONTs should support GEM transport of user traffic, and the ATM transport mode is deprecated.
There is only one connection model for GEM transport, which is the simple point-to-point transfer
of user data via a GEM connection across the PON. GEM interworking always occurs in the OLT
and the ONT, and GEM never extends beyond the PON link.
In the special case where the ONT supports an ATM UNI (ADSL is the notable example), the ATM
connection from the customer must be terminated by the ONT. In this case, the OMCI also supports
the required configuration methods to manage this function.
7.2       Fault management
The ONT supports limited fault management only. Most of the operations are limited to failure
indication. The OMCI supports failure reporting on many managed entities that are described
throughout clause 9. An alarm table is defined for each of these entities.
To avoid erratic floods of alarm messages, it is common to filter, or soak, defects such as facility
impairments before declaring them as alarms, and to soak defect clearing before retiring the alarm.
The declaration soak time is typically 2.5±0.5 seconds, while the retirement soak time is typically
10.5±0.5 seconds. Which alarms are to be soaked, and what the soak intervals should be, are
regarded as vendor-specific choices. Interoperability considerations, however, require that alarms
be soaked at exactly one of the OLT or ONT, and this Recommendation specifies that they be
soaked at the ONT.
7.3       Performance management
The ONT has only limited performance monitoring. The OMCI supports performance monitoring
using a subset of managed entities that are described throughout clause 9. These managed entities
can be identified by the words "performance monitoring history data" in their names.
Note that all performance monitoring related managed entities are created at the request of the OLT.
All history data shall be maintained in the OLT.
7.4       Security management
[ITU-T G.984.3] specifies some mechanisms from the viewpoint of security. That includes the
downstream data encryption of the ONT. The ONT2-G managed entity can enable/disable the
downstream encryption function.
This Recommendation supports the protection function. The type C protection configuration that is
defined in [b-ITU-T G.984.1] is considered in this Recommendation. As the switching behaviour
for PON protection will be done in the TC layer, this Recommendation defines a managed entity to
specify the protection capability.
8         Protocol-independent MIB for the OMCI
The OMCI should be defined to allow vendors to offer modular, incremental capabilities to meet
different levels of customer needs. This Recommendation defines a protocol necessary to support
capabilities identified by [ITU-T G.984.2] and [ITU-T G.984.3]. It is important for interoperability,
yet it allows for optional components and future extensions.
A protocol-independent MIB is used to describe the exchange of information across the OMCI. It
forms the basis from which protocol-specific models are defined. This MIB has as much
commonality as possible with the related generic MIB as defined in other ITU-T Recommendations.
It is intended to make the OMCI relatively simple while maintaining consistency with the MIB used
by the interface between the network-element manager and the OLT.
8.1       Managed entities
The protocol-independent MIB presented in this Recommendation is defined in terms of managed
entities. The managed entities are abstract representations of resources and services in an ONT.
This Recommendation uses three levels for indicating the degree of compliance necessary for
specific functions and managed entities associated with the OMCI specification:
•         Requirement (R): Entities necessary for operational compatibility.
•         Conditional requirements (CR): Entities necessary when the specified optional function
          is implemented.
•         Option (O): Entities that may be useful and required by an operator but that are not
          necessary for operational compatibility.
The possible managed entities are listed in Table 8-1. This table also shows the clause within this
Recommendation that defines each ME.

8.2      Managed entity relation diagrams
The relationships between the required managed entities are given in the following figures.
Figure 8.2-1 gives the legend of symbols used in these diagrams. Note that the threshold data 1/2
managed entity may be associated with any managed entity that has thresholded counters (the PM
history data MEs). This is indicated by a special symbol to reduce congestion on the figures. Also
note that several managed entities in the figures are optional or conditionally required; hence, they
may not be used in some implementations.

8.2.2     Layer 2 functions
There are two major layer 2 functions available: MAC bridging and "802.1p mapping". MAC
bridging is described in [IEEE 802.1D]. The bridge described by Figure 8.2.2-1 below has many
features, and can be used to direct traffic based on MAC address (that is, true bridging) or on
VLAN characteristics (using the VLAN filter feature). The mapping function describes the steering
of traffic from one UNI-side entity to 1-8 ANI-side port-IDs, as shown in Figure 8.2.2-2 below. The
mapper is equivalent to a MAC bridge with VLAN filters that only operate on the priority bits of
the VLAN tags.

These two basic layer 2 services can be used in various combinations to achieve different overall
connectivities. There are three major functional styles of layer 2 connectivity, illustrated in
Figures 8.2.2-3 to 8.2.2-5:
•         N:1 bridging, where a bridge is used to serve multiple UNI ports from a single ANI service.
•         1:M mapping, where a mapper is used to serve a single UNI with multiple ANI
          connections, based on 802.1p priorities.
•         1:P filtering, where a bridge with filters is used to serve a single UNI with multiple ANI
          connections, based on some VLAN information other than 802.1p priorities.
Given these three basic possibilities, there are also four more complex combinations as well,
illustrated in Figures 8.2.2-6 to 8.2.2-9. It is strongly encouraged that these applications be utilized
before other, more exotic styles of usage.

Finally, Figure 8.2.2-10 illustrates the usage of the multicast interworking termination point. A
bridge is used to multiplex the multiple ANI-side ports into the single (in this case) UNI-side port. It
is essential to have a unicast path in parallel to the multicast path, because the unicast path carries
the upstream signalling that is required for control of the multicast transmissions. In most scenarios,
a unicast path already exists for other user communications.

9       MIB description
This clause defines all ONT managed entities (MEs) of interest to G-PON. Code points for a
number of managed entities are permanently reserved for B-PON legacy implementations; these
managed entities remain available for use in G-PON if needed, but their definitions appear only in
[ITU-T G.983.2], rather than below. In a few cases, managed entities that were specifically defined
for G-PON have proven to be of little interest. As with B-PON MEs, their code points are
permanently reserved for backward compatibility, but in the interest of brevity, their definitions
have been omitted from this revision of this Recommendation.
Managed entity (ME) descriptions include:
a)      The purpose of the entity.
b)      The relationships that the entity supports with other managed entities.
c)      The attributes of the entity.
d)      The management operations (actions) that may be performed on the entity. Actions such as
        create, delete, get, get next, set and get current data are generic and are merely listed in the
        description of a given ME. Other actions are described in more detail.
e)       The notifications generated by the managed entity. These may be attribute value changes
         (AVCs), alarms or performance monitoring threshold crossing alerts. Tables define each of
         these three classes as needed for each ME type.
These clauses are organized as follows:
9.1      Equipment management
9.2      ANI management
9.3      Layer 2 data services
9.4      Layer 3 data services
9.5      Ethernet services
9.6      802.11 services
9.7      xDSL services
9.8      TDM services
9.9      Voice services
9.10     MoCA
9.11     Traffic management
9.12     General purpose MEs
9.13     Miscellaneous services
A managed entity can be instantiated by the ONT autonomously or on explicit request of the OLT
via a create command. Attributes of a managed entity for which no create action exists (i.e., a
managed entity that is auto-instantiated by the ONT) can be (R), (W) or (R, W).
On the other hand, attributes of a managed entity for which a create action exists (i.e., a managed
entity that is instantiated on explicit request by the OLT) can be either (R), (W), (R, W), (R,
Set-by-create), (W, Set-by-create) or (R, W, Set-by-create). Where appropriate, this
Recommendation specifies a default value, to be assigned to the attribute on instantiation of the
managed entity.
The following explains each case in more detail:
(R):                     On instantiation of the managed entity, either autonomously or on request of
                         the OLT via a create action, the ONT sets the attribute to a default value or
                         to a value that reflects a current state or measurement. The OLT can only
                         read the value of the attribute. In case of an autonomous attribute value
                         change, the ONT may send an attribute value change notification (AVC) to
                         the OLT.
(W):                     On instantiation of the managed entity, either autonomously or on request of
                         the OLT via a create action, an initial value may or may not be specified.
                         The OLT can only write the value of the attribute. Such an attribute never
                         triggers an AVC notification to the OLT.
(R, W):                  On instantiation of the managed entity, either autonomously or on request of
                         the OLT via a create action, the ONT sets the attribute to a default value.
                         The OLT can both read and write the value of the attribute. In case of an
                         autonomous attribute value change, the ONT may send an AVC notification
                         to the OLT.
                            via a create action, the ONT sets the attribute to the value specified in the
                            create command. Subsequently, the OLT cannot change the value of the
                            attribute. This combination is used mostly for managed entity IDs, but
                            occasionally for attributes that cannot meaningfully change after ME
                            creation.
(W, Set-by-create):         On instantiation of the managed entity, by necessity on request of the OLT
                            via a create action, the ONT sets the attribute to the value specified in the
                            create command. Subsequently, the OLT can only write the value of the
                            attribute. Such an attribute never triggers an AVC notification to the OLT.
(R, W, Set-by-create): On instantiation of the managed entity, by necessity on request of the OLT
                            via a create action, the ONT sets the attribute to the value specified in the
                            create command. Subsequently, the OLT can both read and write the value
                            of the attribute. In case of an autonomous attribute value change, the ONT
                            may send an AVC notification to the OLT. In a number of cases, it is
                            logically impossible to change (write) the value of an attribute after the ME
                            is created. However, chicken and egg issues can arise when several such
                            MEs point to each other. Allowing such attributes to be set after creation is
                            intended to avoid these issues.
The notifications generated by a managed entity stem from the following events: alarms, attribute
value changes (AVCs), threshold crossing alerts (TCAs) and test results.
Alarms, TCAs and failures of autonomous self tests are all reported via alarm messages. The alarm
reporting message contains a field of 224 bits, which is mapped to as many as 208 specific alarms
by the definition of each managed entity. The last 16 bits are reserved for vendor-specific alarms
and are not to be standardized. Alarm bits are numbered from 0 upward. The general schema is
illustrated in the following table, where each managed entity definition may specify some of the
208 reserved points for its own alarms. Different ME types can re-use the same codepoints because
the alarm report message includes the ME type (and instance).
                                        Generic alarm bit assignment
              Number                         Alarm                            Description
            0..207           Reserved
            208..223         Vendor-specific alarms                  Not to be standardized
AVCs are reported via attribute value change messages. A managed entity can encompass not more
than 16 attributes, exclusive of the ME ID, and the attribute change message contains a bit map of
16 bits that match attributes in order, starting with 1. If a managed entity can generate AVCs, its
definition includes an AVC table that matches attributes with their corresponding bit numbers for
easy reference. Attributes that do not trigger AVC notifications are shown as N/A, while bit
positions for non-existent attributes are shown as reserved.
Test results are reported:
a)        via a test result message if the test is invoked by a test command from the OLT; or
b)        via an alarm message in the case of failure of an autonomous self test in the start-up phase;
          or
c)        via an autonomous test result message if a test failure is detected autonomously by the
          ONT.
Details about these messages and their coding appear in Appendix II.
An ONT may be physically implemented as a single module (integrated ONT) or as a shelf
containing plug-in field-replaceable units. The latter construction is technically called an ONU, but
this Recommendation often uses the terms interchangeably to refer to either. Except for
equipment-specific features, the same criteria pertain to both versions.
An ONU with physical slots automatically instantiates cardholder MEs for each of its slots. A slot
can then be populated with a circuit pack. Physical slots are recommended to number from left to
right, then from bottom to top.
An integrated ONT may or may not model itself with virtual cardholders and circuit packs. If not,
the ONT itself is understood to exist in virtual slot 0, since a number of MEs use the slot id as part
of their identifiers.
When subscriber and PON-side physical ports are grouped into real or virtual circuit packs, each of
which supports only a single type of interface, the port numbering algorithm is clear. An integrated
ONT may choose not to model itself with virtual cardholders, and a complex circuit pack may have
ports of several types, for example a PON ANI, a video UNI and a craft port. The port mapping
package provides a flexible way to associate port numbers with a heterogeneous assortment of
ports.
9.1.1     ONT-G
This managed entity represents the ONT as equipment. The ONT automatically creates an instance
of this managed entity. It assigns values to read-only attributes according to data within the ONT
itself.
Relationships
All other managed entities in this Recommendation are related directly or indirectly to the ONT-G
entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:      This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                        There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Vendor id:              This attribute identifies the vendor of the ONT. It is the same as the four
                        most significant bytes of the ONT serial number as specified in
                        [ITU-T G.984.3]. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Version:                This attribute identifies the version of the ONT as defined by the vendor.
                        The character value "0" indicates that version information is not available
                        or applicable. (R) (mandatory) (14 bytes)
Serial number:          The serial number is unique for each ONT. It is defined in
                        [ITU-T G.984.3] and contains the vendor ID and version number. The first
                        four bytes are an ASCII-encoded vendor ID four letter mnemonic. The
                        second four bytes are a binary encoded serial number, under the control of
                        the ONT vendor. (R) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
management             implemented in the ONT. There are two options:
option:                0     Priority controlled and flexibly scheduled upstream traffic. The traffic
                             scheduler and priority queue mechanism are used for upstream traffic.
                       1     Rate controlled upstream traffic. The maximum upstream traffic of
                             each individual connection is guaranteed.
                       For clarification, see Appendix III.
                       Downstream priority queues are managed via the GEM port network
                       CTP ME.
                       Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to the value that
                       describes its implementation. The OLT must adapt its model to conform to
                       the ONT's selection. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
VP/VC                  This attribute is not used. If it is present, it should be set to 0. (R)
cross-connection       (optional) (1 byte)
function option:
Battery backup:        This Boolean attribute specifies whether the ONT/NT supports backup
                       battery monitoring. False disables battery alarm monitoring; true enables
                       battery alarm monitoring. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Administrative         This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
state:                 managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                       functions are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this managed
                       entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer generated.
                       Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the scope of this
                       Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:     This attribute reports whether the managed entity is currently capable of
                       performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1). (R)
                       (optional) (1 byte)
Actions
Get, set
Reboot:                Reboot the ONT.
Test:                  Test the ONT. The test action can be used either to perform equipment
                       diagnostics or to measure parameters such as received optical power, video
                       output level, battery voltage, etc. Extensions to the test and test response
                       messages are defined for these purposes; refer to Appendix II.
Synchronize time:      This action synchronizes the start time of all performance monitoring
                       managed entities of the ONT with the reference time of the OLT. All
                       counters of all monitoring managed entities are cleared to 0 and restarted.
                       Also, the value of the interval end time attribute of the monitoring managed
                       entities is set to 0 and restarted. See clause I.1.9 for further discussion
                       of PM.
Notifications
Test result:           Test results are reported via a test result message if the test is invoked by a
                       test command from the OLT.

9.1.2     ONT2-G
This managed entity contains additional attributes associated with the G-PON ONT. The ONT
automatically creates an instance of this managed entity. Its attributes are populated according to
the data within the ONT itself.
Relationships
This managed entity is paired with the ONT-G entity.
Managed entity id:     This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                       There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Equipment id:          This attribute may be used to identify the specific type of ONT. In North

Security mode:         This attribute specifies the current security mode of the ONT. All secure
                       GEM ports in an ONT must use the same security mode at any given time.
                       The following codepoints are defined:
                       0        Reserved.

                       Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 1, AES. If new
                       encryption modes are standardized, then AES will be the default, and the
                       new modes will be settable via writing to this attribute. This does not mean
                       that any channels are encrypted; that process is negotiated at the PLOAM

9.1.3     ONT data
This managed entity models the MIB itself. Clause I.1.2 explains the use of this managed entity
with respect to MIB synchronization. Clause I.1.4 explains the alarm synchronization process, in
which the get alarm messages are directed to the ONT data managed entity.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity, and updates the associated
attributes according to data within the ONT itself.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity is contained in an ONT.
Managed entity id:      This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                        There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
MIB data sync:          This attribute is used to check the alignment of the MIB of the ONT with
                        the corresponding MIB in the OLT. MIB data sync relies on this attribute,
                        which is a sequence number that can be checked by the OLT to see if the
                        MIB snapshots for the OLT and ONT match. Refer to clause I.1.1 for a
                        detailed description of this attribute. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets
                        this attribute to 0. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)

9.1.4   Software image
This managed entity models an executable software image stored in the ONT.
The ONT automatically creates two instances of this managed entity upon the creation of each
managed entity that contains independently-manageable software, either the ONT itself or an
individual circuit pack. The ME attributes are populated according to data within the ONT or the
circuit pack.
Some pluggable equipments may contain no software. Others may contain software that is
intrinsically bound to the ONT's own software image. No software image ME need exist for such
equipments, though it may be convenient for the ONT to create them to support software version
audit from the OLT. In this case, the dependent MEs would support only the get action.
A slot may contain various equipments over its lifetime, and if software image MEs exist, the ONT
must automatically create and delete them as the equipage changes.
When controller packs are duplicated, each can be expected to contain two software image MEs,
managed through reference to the individual controller packs themselves. When this occurs, the
activate, commit) directed to instance 0 would be ambiguous.
Relationships
Two instances of the software image managed entity are associated with each instance of the ONT
or circuit pack whose software is independently managed.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                           two-byte value indicates the physical location of the software image. The
                           first byte identifies the ME instance (ONT (0) or slot (1..254)) containing
                           the associated software image ME. The second byte distinguishes between
                           the two software image ME instances (0..1). (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Version:                   This attribute identifies the version of the software. (R) (mandatory)
                           (14 bytes)
Is committed:              This attribute indicates whether the associated software image is committed
                           (1) or uncommitted (0). By definition, the committed software image is
                           loaded and executed upon reboot of the ONT and/or circuit pack. During
                           normal operation, one software image is always committed, while the other
                           is uncommitted. Under no circumstances are both software images allowed
                           to be committed at the same time. On the other hand, both software images
                           could be uncommitted at the same time if both were invalid. Upon ME
                           instantiation, instance 0 is initialized to committed, while instance 1 is
                           initialized to uncommitted (that is, the ONT ships from the factory with
                           image 0 committed). (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Is active:                 This attribute indicates whether the associated software image is active (1)
                           or inactive (0). By definition, the active software image is one that is
                           currently loaded and executing in the ONT or circuit pack. Under normal
                           operation, one software image is always active while the other is inactive.
                           Under no circumstances are both software images allowed to be active at the
                           same time. On the other hand, both software images could be inactive at the
                           same time if both were invalid. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Is valid:                  This attribute indicates whether the associated software image is valid (1) or
                           invalid (0). By definition, a software image is valid if it has been verified to
                           be an executable code image. The verification mechanism is not subject to
                           standardization; however, at a minimum it must include a data integrity
                           (CRC) check of the entire code image. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT
                           validates the associated code image and sets this attribute according to the
                           result. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)

NOTE – Figure 9.1.4-1 illustrates the life cycle of software images under the following actions. State S0 is a
conceptual initialization state when neither of the software images is valid (i.e., executable). During S0, the
OMCC is not functional.
All of the following actions are mandatory for ONTs with remotely manageable software.
Start download:        Initiate a software download sequence. This action is valid only for a
                       software image that is currently inactive and uncommitted (i.e., not selected
                       as the boot image).
Download section:      Download a section of a software image. This action is valid only for a
                       software image that is currently being downloaded (image 1 in state S2,
                       image 0 in state S2').
End download:          Signal the completion of a download sequence, providing both CRC and
                       version information for final verification of a downloaded software image.
                       This action is valid only for a software image that is currently being
                       downloaded (image 1 in state S2, image 0 in state S2').
Activate image:        Load/execute a valid software image. When this action is applied to a
                       software image that is currently inactive, execution of the current code
                       image is suspended, the associated software image is loaded from
                       non-volatile memory, and execution of this new code image is initiated (that
                       is, the associated entity re-boots on the previously inactive image). When
                       this action is applied to a software image that is already active, a soft restart
                       is performed. The software image is not reloaded from non-volatile
                       memory; the current volatile code image is simply restarted. This action is
                       only valid for a valid software image.
Commit image:          Select a valid software image to be the default image to be loaded and
                       executed by the boot code upon start-up (i.e., set the is committed attribute
                       value to 1 for the associated software image ME and set the is committed
                       attribute value to 0 for the other software image). This action is only valid
                       for a valid software image.

9.1.5     Cardholder
The cardholder represents the fixed equipment slot configuration of the ONT. One or more of these
entities is contained in the ONT. Each cardholder can contain 0 or 1 circuit packs; the circuit pack
models equipment information that can change over the lifetime of the ONT, e.g., through
replacement.
An instance of this managed entity exists for each physical slot in an ONT that has pluggable circuit
packs. One or more instances of this managed entity may also exist in an integrated ONT, to
represent virtual slots. Instances of this managed entity are created automatically by the ONT, and
the status attributes are populated according to data within the ONT itself.
There is potential for conflict in the semantics of the expected plug-in unit type, the expected port
count and the expected equipment id, both when the slot is not populated and when a new circuit
pack is inserted. The expected plug-in unit type and the plug-in type mismatch alarm are
mandatory, although plug-and-play/unknown (circuit pack type 255) may be used as a way to
minimize their significance. It is recommended that an ONT deny the provisioning of inconsistent
combinations of expected equipment attributes.
When a circuit pack is plugged into a cardholder, or when a cardholder is preprovisioned to expect a
circuit pack of a given type, it may trigger the ONT to instantiate a number of managed entities and
update the values of others, depending on the circuit pack type. The ONT may also delete a variety
of other managed entities when a circuit pack is reprovisioned to expect no circuit pack or a circuit
pack of a different type. These actions are described in the definitions of the various managed
entities.
Expected equipment id and expected port count are alternate ways to trigger the same
preprovisioning effects. These tools may be useful if an ONT is prepared to accept more than one
circuit pack of a given type but with different port counts, or if a circuit pack is a hybrid that
matches none of the types in Table 9.1.5-1, but whose identification (e.g., part number) is known.
Relationships
An ONT may contain one or more instances of the cardholder, each of which may contain an
instance of the circuit pack managed entity. The slot id, real or virtual, is a fundamental
identification mechanism for managed entities with some relationship to physical location.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                          ONT sets the first byte of this two-byte identifier to:
                          0        if the ONT contains pluggable equipment modules;
                          1        if the ONT is a single integrated equipment.
                          The second byte of this identifier is the slot number. In integrated ONTs,
                          this byte may be used as a virtual slot or set to 0 to indicate a universal
                          pseudo-slot.
                          Slot numbering schemes differ among vendors. It is only required that slot
                          numbers be unique across the ONT. Up to 254 equipment slots are
                          supported in the range 1..254 (Note 1). The value 0 is reserved to indicate a
                          universal pseudo-slot. The value 255 is also reserved. (R) (mandatory)
                          (2 bytes)
                          NOTE 1 – Some xDSL managed entities use the two most significant bits of the
                          slot number for other purposes. An ONT that supports these services may have slot
                          limitations or restrictions.
Actual plug-in unit   This attribute is equal to the type of the circuit pack in the cardholder or 0 if
type:                 the cardholder is empty. This attribute is then redundant with the type
                      attribute of the circuit pack managed entity. Circuit pack types are defined
                      in Table 9.1.5-1. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                      The three following attributes permit the OLT to specify its intentions for
                      future equipage of a slot. Once some or all of these are set, the ONT can
                      proceed to instantiate circuit pack and PPTP MEs, along with other
                      predeterminable MEs, and allow the OLT to create related discretionary
                      MEs, thereby supporting service preprovisioning.
Expected plug-in unit This attribute provisions the type of circuit pack for the slot. For type
type:                 coding, see Table 9.1.5-1. The value 0 means that the cardholder is not
                      provisioned to contain a circuit pack. The value 255 means that the
                      cardholder is configured for plug-and-play. Upon ME instantiation, the
                      ONT sets this attribute to 0. For integrated interfaces, this attribute may be
                      used to represent the type of interface. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Expected port count: This attribute permits the OLT to specify the number of ports it expects in a
                      circuit pack. Prior to provisioning by the OLT, the ONT initializes this
                      attribute to 0. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Expected equipment This attribute provisions the specific type of expected circuit pack. This
id:                   attribute applies only to ONTs that do not have integrated interfaces. In
                      North America, this may be the expected equipment CLEI code. Upon ME
                      instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to all spaces. (R, W) (optional)
                      (20 bytes)
Actual equipment id: This attribute identifies the specific type of circuit pack, once it is installed.
                      This attribute applies only to ONTs that do not have integrated interfaces. In
                      North America, this may be the equipment CLEI code. When the slot is
                      empty or the equipment ID is not known, this attribute should be set to all
                      spaces. (R) (optional) (20 bytes)
Protection profile    This attribute indicates an equipment protection profile that may be
pointer:              associated with the cardholder. Its value is the least significant byte of the
                      managed entity ID of the equipment protection profile with which it is
                      associated, or 0 if equipment protection is not used. (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Invoke protection     The OLT may use this attribute to control equipment protection switching.
switch:               Code points have the following meaning when set by the OLT:
                      0        Release protection switch.
                      1        Operate protection switch, protect cardholder unspecified.

                      3        Operate protection switch, use second protect cardholder.
                      The ONT should deny attempts to switch to an unequipped, defective or
                      already active protection cardholder.
                      Upon the get action from the OLT, this attribute should return the current
                      value of the actual protection configuration. Code points are as defined
                      above, except that the value 1 is never returned.
                      When circuit packs that support a PON IF function are switched, the
                      response should be returned on the same PON that received the command.
                      However, the OLT should also be prepared to accept a response on the
                      redundant PON. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)

9.1.6    Circuit pack
This managed entity models a circuit pack that is equipped in an ONT slot. For ONTs with
integrated interfaces, this managed entity may be used to distinguish available types of interfaces
(the port mapping package is another way).
For ONTs with integrated interfaces, the ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed
entity for each instance of the virtual cardholder managed entity. The ONT also creates an instance
of this managed entity when the OLT provisions the cardholder to expect a circuit pack (i.e., when
the OLT sets the expected plug-in unit type or equipment ID of the cardholder to a circuit pack
type, as defined in clause 9.1.5). The ONT also creates an instance of this managed entity when a
circuit pack is installed in a cardholder whose expected plug-in unit type is 255 = plug-and-play,
and whose equipment ID is not provisioned. Finally, when the cardholder is provisioned for
plug-and-play, an instance of this managed entity can be created at the request of the OLT.
The ONT deletes an instance of this managed entity when the OLT de-provisions the circuit pack
(i.e., when the OLT sets the expected plug-in unit type or equipment ID of the cardholder to 0 = no
LIM). The ONT also deletes an instance of this managed entity on request of the OLT if the
expected plug-in unit type attribute of the corresponding cardholder is equal to 255, plug-and-play,
and the expected equipment ID is blank (a string of all spaces). ONTs with integrated interfaces do
not delete circuit pack instances.
NOTE – Creation and deletion by the OLT is retained for backward compatibility.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is contained by an instance of the cardholder managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:     This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. Its
                       value is the same as that of the cardholder managed entity containing this
                       circuit pack instance. (R, Set-by-create (if applicable)) (mandatory)
                       (22 bytes)
Type:                  This attribute identifies the circuit pack type. This attribute is a code as
                       defined in Table 9.1.5-1. The value 255 means unknown or undefined, i.e.,
                       the inserted circuit pack is not recognized by the ONT or is not mapped to
                       an entry in Table 9.1.5-1. In the latter case, the equipment ID attribute may
                       contain inventory information. Upon autonomous ME instantiation, the
                       ONT sets this attribute to 0 or to the type of the circuit pack that is
                       physically present. (R, Set-by-create (if applicable)) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Number of ports:       This attribute is the number of access ports on the circuit pack. If the port
                       mapping package-G is supported for this circuit pack, this attribute should
                       be set to the total number of ports of all types. (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Serial number:         The serial number is unique for each circuit pack. Note that the serial
                       number may contain the vendor ID and/or version number. For integrated
                       ONTs, this value is identical to the value of the serial number attribute of
                       the ONT-G managed entity. Upon creation in the absence of a physical
                       circuit pack, this attribute comprises all spaces. (R) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
Version:               This attribute is a string that identifies the version of the circuit pack as
                       defined by the vendor. The value 0 indicates that version information is not
                       available or applicable. For integrated ONTs, this value is identical to the
                       value of the version attribute of the ONT-G managed entity. Upon creation
                       in the absence of a physical circuit pack, this attribute comprises all spaces.
                       (R) (mandatory) (14 bytes)
Vendor id:             This attribute identifies the vendor of the circuit pack. For ONTs with
                       integrated interfaces, this value is identical to the value of the vendor ID
                       attribute of the ONT-G managed entity. Upon creation in the absence of a
                       physical circuit pack, this attribute comprises all spaces. (R) (optional)
                       (4 bytes)
Administrative state: This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by the
                       circuit pack. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user functions
                       of this circuit pack are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this
                       managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer generated.
                       Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the scope of this
                       Recommendation. (R, W, Set-by-create (if applicable)) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:     This attribute indicates whether or not the circuit pack is capable of
                       performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0), disabled (1) and
                       unknown (2). Pending completion of initialization and self test on an
                       installed circuit pack, the ONT sets this attribute to 2. (R) (optional) (1 byte)

                     (1 byte)
Equipment id:        This attribute may be used to identify the vendor's specific type of circuit
                     pack. In North America, this may be the CLEI code. Upon ME instantiation,
                     the ONT sets this attribute to all spaces or to the equipment ID of the circuit
                     pack that is physically present. (R) (optional) (20 bytes)
Card configuration: This attribute selects the appropriate configuration on configurable circuit
                     packs (e.g., T1/E1). Table 9.1.5-1 specifies three configurable card types:
                     A45/34 (code 9), C-DS1/E1 (code 16), and C-DS1/E1/J1 (code 17). Values
                     are indicated below for the allowed card types and configurations.

Total T-CONT buffer This attribute reports the total number of T-CONT buffers associated with
number:              the circuit pack. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0 or
                     to the value supported by the physical circuit pack. (R) (mandatory for
                     circuit packs that provide a traffic scheduler function) (1 byte)
Total priority queue This value reports the total number of priority queues associated with the
number:              circuit pack. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets the attribute to 0 or to the
                     value supported by the physical circuit pack. (R) (mandatory for circuit
                     packs that provide a traffic scheduler function) (1 byte)
Total traffic        This value reports the total number of traffic schedulers associated with the
scheduler number:    circuit pack. The ONT supports null function, HOL (head of line)
                     scheduling and WRR (weighted round robin) from the priority control and
                     guarantee of minimum rate control points of view, respectively. If the
                     circuit pack has no traffic scheduler, this attribute should be 0. Upon ME
                     instantiation, the ONT sets the attribute to 0 or to the value supported by the

9.1.7      ONT power shedding
This managed entity models the ONT's ability to shed services when the ONT goes into battery
operation mode after AC power failure. Shedding classes are defined, which may span multiple
circuit pack types. This feature works in conjunction with the power shed override attribute of the
circuit pack managed entity, which can selectively prevent power shedding of priority ports.
An ONT that supports power shedding automatically creates an instance of this managed entity.
Table 9.1.5-1. In the case of hybrid LIM types, multiple shedding classes may affect a circuit pack
if the hardware is capable of partial power shedding.
An ONT may choose to model its ports with the port mapping package-G of clause 9.1.8, rather
than with real or virtual circuit packs. In this case, power shedding pertains to individual PPTPs, as
listed in the second column of the table.

9.1.8     Port mapping package-G
This managed entity provides a way to map a heterogeneous set of physical path termination points
(ports) to a parent equipment, which may be a cardholder or the ONT itself. It could be useful, for
example, if a single plug-in circuit pack contained a PON ANI as port 1, a video UNI as port 2, and
a craft UNI as port 3. It also provides an option for an integrated ONT to represent its ports without
the use of virtual cardholders and virtual circuit packs.
If the port mapping package-G is supported for the ONT as a whole, it is automatically created by
the ONT. If the port mapping package-G is supported for plug-in circuit packs, it is created and
destroyed by the ONT when the corresponding circuit pack is installed or preprovisioned in a
cardholder.
The port list attributes specify ports 1..64 sequentially. Each port list contains a sequence of ME
types, as defined in Table 11-2. These ME type codes define what kind of PPTP or ANI
corresponds to the specific port number. For example, for a circuit pack with 4 POTS ports,
2 VDSL ports, and 1 video port, numbered sequentially in that order, the attributes would be coded:
Max ports:       7
Port list 1:      53, 53, 53, 53, 117, 117, 82, 0
Port list 2..8:   All zero
Relationships

Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.

Max ports:               This attribute indicates the largest port number contained in the port list
                         attributes. Ports are numbered from 1 to this maximum, possibly with
                         embedded 0 entries, but no port may exist beyond the maximum. (R)
                         (mandatory) (1 byte)
                         Each of the following attributes is a list of 8 ports, in increasing port number
                         sequence. Each list entry is a two-byte field containing the managed entity
                         type of the UNI or ANI corresponding to the port number. Managed entity
                         types are defined in Table 11-2. Placeholders for unused port numbers are
                         indicated with the value 0.

Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.

                       example physical security detectors at an enclosure. Each pair of bits is
                       defined as follows:
                       00      Sense point disabled (default).
                       01      Report contact closure.
                       10      Report contact open.
                       11      Sense point disabled (same as 00).
                       If the byte is represented in binary as 0B hhgg ffee ddcc bbaa, bits hh
                       correspond to sense point 1, while bits aa correspond to sense point 8.
                       (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
                       NOTE – Some specific sense point applications are already defined on the ONT-G
                       managed entity. It is the vendor's choice how to configure and report sense points
                       that appear both generically and specifically.
Contact closure        This attribute provisions an ONT that supports external contact closure
output:                outputs, for example sump pump or air conditioner activation at an ONT
                       enclosure. A contact point is said to be released when it is not energized.
                       Whether this corresponds to an open or a closed electrical circuit depends
                       on the ONT's wiring options. Upon ONT initialization, all contact points
                       should go to the released state.
                       If the byte is represented in binary as 0B hhgg ffee ddcc bbaa, bits hh
                       correspond to contact output point 1, while bits aa correspond to contact
                       output point 8.
                       On write, the bits of this attribute have the following meaning:
                       0x       No change to contact output point state.
                       10       Release contact output point.
                       11       Operate contact output point.
                       On read, the left bit in each pair should be set to 0 at the ONT and ignored
                       at the OLT. The right bit indicates a released output point with 0 and an
                       operated point with 1. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)

9.1.10 Protection data
This managed entity models the capability and parameters of PON protection. An ONT that
supports PON protection automatically creates an instance of this managed entity.
NOTE – Equipment protection is modelled with the equipment protection profile and cardholder managed
entities.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity is associated with two instances of the ANI-G. One of the
ANI-G managed entities represents the working side; the other represents the protection side.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            This ME is numbered in ascending order from 0. (R) (mandatory)
                            (2 bytes)
Working ANI-G               This attribute points to the ANI-G managed entity that represents the
pointer:                    working side of PON protection. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Protection ANI-G            This attribute points to the ANI-G managed entity that represents the

                            0        1+1 protection.
                            1        1:1 protection without extra traffic.
                            2        1:1 protection with ability to support extra traffic.
                            (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Revertive ind:              This attribute indicates whether protection is revertive (1) or
                            non-revertive (0). (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Wait to restore time:       This attribute specifies the time, in seconds, to wait after a fault clear
                            before switching back to the working side. Upon ME instantiation, the
                            ONT sets this attribute to 3 seconds. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Switching guard time:       This attribute specifies the time, in milliseconds, to wait after the
                            detection of a fault before performing a protection switch. Selection of a
                            default value for this attribute is outside the scope of this
                            Recommendation, as it is normally handled through supplier-operator
                            negotiations. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)

9.1.11 Equipment protection profile
This managed entity supports equipment protection. There can be as many as two protection slots
protecting as many as eight working slots. Each of the working and protect cardholder managed
entities should refer to the equipment protection profile that defines its protection group. Instances
of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
An ONT should deny pre-provisioning that would create impossible protection groupings because
of slot or equipment incompatibilities. In the same way, the ONT should deny creation or addition
to protection groups that cannot be supported by the current equipage. Even so, an inconsistent card
type alarm is defined, for example to cover the case of a plug-and-play circuit pack installed in a
protection group cardholder that cannot support it.
Relationships
An instance of this object points to the working and protect cardholders, which in turn point back to
this managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                         first byte is 0. The second byte is assigned by the OLT, and must be unique
                         and non-zero. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)

Revertive ind:           This attribute specifies whether equipment protection is revertive. The
                         default value 0 indicates revertive switching; any other value indicates
                         non-revertive switching. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
                          equipment must be free of error before a revertive switch occurs. It defaults

9.1.12 ONT remote debug
This managed entity is used to send vendor-specific debug commands to the ONT and receive
vendor-specific replies back for processing on the OLT. This allows for the remote debugging of an
ONT that may not be accessible by any other means. The command format may have two modes,
one being text and the other free format. In text format, both the command and reply are ASCII
strings. In free format, the content and format of command and reply are vendor-specific.
An ONT that supports remote debugging automatically creates an instance of this managed entity. It
is not reported during a MIB upload.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity is associated with the ONT managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Command format:           This attribute defines the format of the command and reply attributes.
                          Value 0 defines ASCII string format, while 1 specifies free format. (R)
                          (mandatory) (1 byte)
Command:                  This attribute is used to send a command to the ONT. The format of the
                          command is defined by the command format. If the format is ASCII string,
                          the command should be null terminated unless the string is 25 bytes long.
                          The action of setting this attribute should trigger the ONT to discard any
                          previous command reply information and execute the current debugging
                          command. (W) (mandatory) (25 bytes)
                       is defined by the command format attribute. The get, get next action
                       sequence must be used with this attribute, since its size is unspecified. On a
                       get action, the ONT returns the size of the reply (per normal get next usage).
                       If the size of the reply is unknown at the time of the get, the ONT returns
                       the value 0xFFFF FFFF. The OLT then issues get next requests until the
                       ONT is exhausted of data, whereupon the ONT returns a parameter error
                       response. The OLT then terminates the get next process. (R) (mandatory)

9.2     ANI management
Although the OLT maintains some of the PON-related managed entities and attributes via G.984.3
PLOAM messages, there is also information to be negotiated in OMCC. Therefore, the ONT
autonomously creates at least one instance of each of the managed entities ANI-G and T-CONT.
These ANI management MEs are included in a MIB upload.
9.2.1   ANI-G
This managed entity organizes data associated with each access network interface supported by the
ONT. The ONT automatically creates one instance of this managed entity for each PON physical
port.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a physical PON interface.
Attributes
Managed entity id:     This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. Its
                       value indicates the physical position of the PON IF. The first byte is the slot
                       id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte is the port ID. (R) (mandatory)
                       (2 bytes)
SR indication:         This Boolean attribute indicates the ONT's capability to report queue status
                       for DBA. The value true means that status reporting is available for all
                       T-CONTs that are associated with the ANI. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Total T-CONT           This attribute indicates the total number of T-CONTs that can be supported
number:                on this ANI. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
GEM block length:      This attribute specifies the reporting block size for GEM mode, in units of
                       bytes. The value set by the OLT is used by all T-CONTs on this ANI. Upon
                       ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 48. (R, W) (mandatory)
                       (2 bytes)
reporting:            capabilities. [ITU-T G.984.3] defines three possible piggyback reporting
                      modes. For reporting mode 0, the single field is the entire report. For
                      reporting mode 1, the DBA report is two fields long. For reporting mode 2,
                      the DBA report is four fields long. Mode 0 is mandatory for ONTs that
                      utilize the piggyback DBA reporting method; modes 1 and 2 are optional.
                      The following coding indicates the ONT's piggyback DBA reporting mode
                      capabilities:
                      0        Mode 0 only.
                      1        Modes 0 and 1.

                      3        Modes 0, 1 and 2.
                      4        Piggyback DBA reporting not supported.
                      (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Whole ONT DBA         This attribute indicates that the ONT supports whole ONT DBA reporting
reporting:            (1) as specified in [ITU-T G.984.3], or that it does not (0). (R) (mandatory)
                      (1 byte)
SF threshold:         This attribute specifies the downstream BER threshold to detect the SFi/SF
                      alarm. When this value is y, the BER threshold is 10–y. Valid values are 3..8.
                      Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 5. (R, W) (mandatory)
                      (1 byte)
SD threshold:         This attribute specifies the downstream BER threshold to detect the SDi/SD
                      alarm. When this value is x, the BER threshold for SDi/SD is 10–x. Valid
                      values are 4..10. The SD threshold must be lower than the SF threshold; that
                      is, x > y. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 9. (R, W)
                      (mandatory) (1 byte)

                      (coded as 254) to 0 dBm (coded as 0) in 0.5 dB increments. The default
                      value 0xFF selects the ONT's internal policy. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Upper optical         This attribute specifies the optical level the ONT uses to declare the
threshold:            1490 nm high received optical power alarm. Valid values are –127 dBm
                      (coded as 254) to 0 dBm (coded as 0) in 0.5 dB increments. The default
                      value 0xFF selects the ONT's internal policy. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ONT response time: This attribute indicates actual ONT response time recorded by ONT. The
                        range of this attribute should be in the range described in
                        [ITU-T G.984.3], which is 34..36 microseconds. The unit is nanoseconds;
                        however, the accuracy is likely to be more coarse. Furthermore, the value
                        may change from one ranging cycle to the next. Valid values are:
                        0                     null, function not supported.
                        34000 to 36000        response time in nanoseconds.

9.2.2    T-CONT
An instance of the traffic container managed entity T-CONT represents a logical connection group
associated with a PLOAM layer alloc-id. A T-CONT can accommodate GEM packets in priority
queues or traffic schedulers that exist in the GEM layer.
The ONT autonomously creates instances of this ME. The OLT can discover the number of
T-CONT instances via the ANI-G ME. When the ONT's MIB is reset or created for the first time,
all supported T-CONTs are created. The OLT provisions allocation-IDs to the ONT via the
PLOAM channel. The OLT must then set the alloc-id attributes in the T-CONTs that it wants to
activate for user traffic, to create the appropriate association between the allocation ID set in the
PLOAM channel and the T-CONT in the OMCI. Once that association is created, the mode
indicator attribute assumes the mode specified in the PLOAM channel. Note that there should be a
one-to-one relationship between allocation IDs and T-CONT MEs, and the connection of multiple
T-CONTs to a single allocation ID is undefined.
Note that the first allocation ID that is granted via the PLOAM channel is defined to be the default
alloc-id, and this alloc-id is the one that is used to carry the OMCC. The default alloc-id can also be
used to carry user traffic, and hence can be set into one of the T-CONT MEs. However, this OMCI
relationship only pertains to the user traffic, and the OMCC relationship is unaffected. It can also be
true that the OMCC is not contained in any T-CONT ME construct; rather, that the OMCC remains
outside of the OMCI, and the OMCI is not used to manage the OMCC in any way. The handling of
the multiplexing of OMCC and user data is discussed in clause 11.3.3.

                        It may be represented as 0xSSBB, where SS indicates the slot id that
                        contains this T-CONT (0 for the ONT as a whole), and BB is the T-CONT
                        id, numbered by the ONT itself. T-CONTs are numbered in ascending

9.2.3    GEM port network CTP
This managed entity represents the termination of a GEM port on an ONT. This managed entity
aggregates connectivity functionality from the network view and alarms from the network element
view as well as artefacts from trails.
Instances of the GEM port network CTP managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT. An
instance of GEM port network CTP can be deleted only when no GEM interworking termination
point or GEM port PM history data is associated with it. It is the responsibility of the OLT to make
sure that the GEM port network CTP meets this condition.
When a GEM port network CTP is created, its encryption state is by default not encrypted. If the
OLT wishes to configure the GEM port to use encryption, then the appropriate PLOAM message
must be sent. This applies equally to new CTPs or to CTPs that are re-created after a MIB reset.
Relationships
An instance of the GEM port network CTP managed entity may be associated with an instance of
the T-CONT and GEM interworking termination point managed entities.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. (R,
                         Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Port id value:           This attribute is the port id of the GEM port associated with this CTP. (R,
                         W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
T-CONT pointer:          This attribute points to a T-CONT instance. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                         (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                         NOTE – In previous versions of this Recommendation, this attribute was
                         described as pointing to a PON TC adaptor-G. However, the latter ME had no
                         purpose, de facto, and has been omitted from this version. The instance identifier
                         of the PON TC adaptor was always defined to be identical to that of its
                         corresponding T-CONT, so this documentation change has no practical effect on
                         pre-existing implementations.
Direction:               This attribute specifies whether the GEM port is used for UNI-to-ANI (1),

Traffic management If the traffic management option attribute in the ONT-G ME is 0 (priority
pointer for upstream: controlled), this pointer specifies the priority queue-G ME serving this
                         GEM port network CTP. If the traffic management option attribute is 1
                         (rate controlled), this attribute redundantly points to the T-CONT serving
                         this GEM port network CTP. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Traffic descriptor       This attribute points to the instance of the GEM traffic descriptor managed
profile pointer:         entity that contains the traffic parameters used for this GEM port network
                         CTP ME. This attribute is used when the traffic management option
                         attribute in the ONT-G ME is 1 (rate controlled). (R, W, Set-by-create)

                         mode attribute of the ONT2-G, with the exception that attribute value 0
                         indicates an unencrypted GEM port. (R) (optional) (1 byte)

9.2.5     Multicast GEM interworking termination point
An instance of this managed entity represents a point in the ONT where a multicast service
interworks with the GEM layer. At this point, a multicast bit stream is reconstructed from GEM
packets.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Multicast interworking GEM modes of operation
The default multicast operation of the PON is where all the multicast content streams are placed in
one PON layer connection (GEM port). This connection is then specified in the first entry of the
multicast address table. This single entry also specifies an all-inclusive IP multicast address range
(e.g., 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255). The ONT then filters the traffic based on either Ethernet MAC
addresses or IP addresses. The GEM port network CTP ME contains the GEM port-ID that supports
all multicast connections.
An optional multicast operation is where groups of one or more multicast content streams are
carried over individual PON layer connections, i.e., on separate GEM ports, but terminate on a
single multicast GEM interworking termination point. In this case, the OLT sets as many table
entries as desired for the multicast control system. The ONT can initially filter groups based on
PON layer address (GEM port). In a subsequent step, the ONT can also filter based on higher-layer
addresses. In this case, the OLT need create only one instance of the GEM port network CTP ME.
Though this GEM port network CTP ME cites only one GEM port-ID, the ONT should regard this
ME as the representative of all multicast GEM connections served by the multicast GEM
interworking TP. The traffic descriptors, priority queues, and performance management features for
all multicast connections are integrated into the single GEM port network CTP ME.
Several multicast GEM interworking termination points can exist, each linked to separate bridge
ports or mappers to serve different communities of interest in a complex ONU.
Discovery of multicast support
The OLT uses the multicast GEM IW TP entity as the means to discover the ONT's multicast
capability. This entity is mandatory if multicasting is supported by the ONT. If the OLT attempts to
create this entity on an ONT that does not support multicast, the create command fails; likewise
with attempts to create a multicast address table with more than a single entry or to create multiple
GEM interworking termination points.
and a number of its attributes are not meaningful in a multicast context. These attributes are set to 0
and not used, as indicated below.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity exists for each occurrence of transformation of GEM packets
into a multicast data stream.

                              0        This value is a "no-op" or "do not care". It should be used
                                       when the multicast GEM IW TP is associated with several
                                       functions of different types. It can optionally be used in all
                                       cases, since the necessary information is available elsewhere.

9.2.9    GAL TDM profile
This managed entity organizes data that describes the GTC adaptation layer processing functions of
the ONT for TDM services. [ITU-T G.984.3] explains that the GEM adaptation layer generates a
125 μs GEM frame that accommodates TDM traffic. The length of the TDM partition in the GEM
frame depends on the TDM UNI bit rate. The clock recovery function and structured data transfer
function are not necessary because the GEM is terminated in the PON section.
The receiver of the GEM adaptation layer should check for loss of GEM frame once every 125 μs.
This managed entity is created and deleted on request of the OLT.

                             the bridge to the root bridge. The value 0 means that this bridge is itself
                             the root. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R)
                             (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Hello time:                  This attribute is the hello time received from the designated root, the
                             interval (in 256ths of a second) between hello packets. Its range is

                            is physically down from the case where Ethernet is administratively down,
                            the latter being denoted by disabled.
                            The value stp_off is introduced to denote the port status where spanning tree
                            protocol is disabled by setting the port spanning tree ind attribute of the MAC
                            bridge port configuration data to false, and the Ethernet link state is up. This
                            value distinguishes whether or not frame forwarding is under control of STP.

                              traffic flowing out of the bridge port. In this way, the upstream traffic
                              is filtered on the ANI-side bridge ports, and the downstream traffic is
                              filtered on the UNI-side bridge ports. Each entry contains:

TP pointer:                   This attribute points to an instance of the associated termination point.
                              The termination point type is determined by the TP type attribute:

                          pointer 0xFFFF specifies that frames with the associated priority are to
                          be discarded.

Interwork TP pointer for P-bit priority 7:     (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Unmarked frame option: This attribute specifies how the ONT should handle untagged Ethernet
                          frames received across the associated interface. Valid values include:
                          0   Convert from DSCP to 802.1p.
                          1   Tag frame to a certain value.
                          (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
DSCP to P-bit mapping:    This attribute is valid when the unmarked frame option attribute is set
                          to 0. The DSCP to P-bit attribute can be considered a bit string
                          sequence of 64 three-bit groupings. The 64 sequence entries represent
                          the possible values of the six-bit DSCP field. Each three-bit grouping
                          specifies the P-bit value to which the associated DSCP value should be
                          mapped. Once marked, the P-bit marked frame is then directed to the
                          GEM interworking termination point indicated by the interwork TP
                          pointer mappings. (R, W) (mandatory) (24 bytes)
                          NOTE 2 − If certain bits in the DSCP field are to be ignored in the mapping
                          process, the attribute should be provisioned such that all possible values of
                          those bits produce the same P-bit mapping. This can be applied to the case
                          where the operator wishes to adopt the priority mechanism based on IP
                          precedence instead of full DSCP, which needs only the three MSBs of the
                          DSCP field.
Default P-bit marking:    This attribute is valid when the unmarked frame option attribute is set
                          to 1. The default P-bit marking attribute contains the default P-bit
                          priority setting to be applied. The P-bit marked frame is then directed
                          to the GEM interworking termination point indicated by the interwork
                          TP pointer mappings. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
TP type:                      This attribute identifies the type of termination point associated with
                              the mapper.
                              0 Mapper used for bridging-mapping.
                              1 Mapper directly associated with a PPTP Ethernet UNI.
                              2 Mapper directly associated with an IP host service.
                              3 Mapper directly associated with an Ethernet flow termination point.
                              4 Mapper directly associated with a PPTP xDSL UNI.
                              5 Mapper directly associated with a PPTP 802.11 UNI.

Supplementary explanation
This clause explains the actions specified in the forward operation attribute.
The format of an Ethernet frame for VLAN services is described in [IEEE 802.1Q]:
a)  Basic MAC bridge       As shown in Figure 9.3.11-2, if the DA (destination MAC address) in
    operation:             the received frame is listed in the MAC bridge port bridge table data
                           for one or more ports, this frame is forwarded on those ports.
                           Otherwise, it is flooded to all ports except the receiving port. From the
                           viewpoint of the transmitting port, a frame is forwarded either if its DA
                           is in the port's MAC bridge port bridge table data or if its DA does not
                           appear in the MAC bridge port bridge table data of any port on the
                           bridge. This is the basic behaviour of a bridge that is not aware of
                           VLANs.
                        Figure 9.3.11-2 – Basic MAC bridge operation
Other possible actions are as follows.
b)   Unconditional forwarding of A tagged frame is forwarded without investigation of TCI.
     tagged frame:
c)   Unconditional discarding of        A tagged frame is discarded without investigation of TCI.
     tagged frame:
d)   Unconditional forwarding of An untagged frame is forwarded without investigation of TCI.
     untagged frame:
e)   Unconditional discarding of        An untagged frame is discarded without investigation of TCI.
     untagged frame:
f)   Positive filtering by TCI:         If some or all (Note) of the fields in the TCI of the received
                                        frame are included in the VLAN filter list, it is forwarded
                                        according to action a) as shown in Figure 9.3.11-3. Otherwise,
                                        its TCI is ignored and it is controlled by action a).
                         Figure 9.3.11-3 – Positive filtering by TCI operation
NOTE – The phrase some or all refers to the parts or the entirety of the TCI field called out by the specific
value provisioned into the forward operation attribute.
g)   Negative filtering by TCI:        If some or all of the fields in the TCI of the received frame are
                                       included in the VLAN filter list, it is not forwarded by this port.
                                       Otherwise, it is forwarded according to action a) as shown in
                                       Figure 9.3.11-4.
                       Figure 9.3.11-4 – Negative filtering by TCI operation
h)   Positive filtering by TCI       If some or all of the fields in the TCI of the received frame are
     and dropping for no match: included in the VLAN filter list, it is forwarded according to
                                     action a) as shown in Figure 9.3.11-5. If its TCI is not accepted
                                     by any port on the bridge, the frame is discarded.

9.3.12 VLAN tagging operation configuration data
This managed entity organizes data associated with VLAN tagging. Instances of this managed
entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
Zero or one instance of this managed entity may exist for an instance of any managed entity that can
terminate or modify an Ethernet stream. By definition, tagging operation occurs farther away from
the MAC bridge than filtering.
Attributes
Managed entity id:      This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                        When the optional association type attribute is 0 or undefined, this
                        attribute's value is the same as the id of the managed entity with which
                        this VLAN tagging operation configuration data instance is associated,
                        which may be either a PPTP Ethernet UNI or an IP host config data
                        ME. Otherwise, the value of the ME ID is unconstrained except by the
                        need to be unique. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Upstream VLAN tagging This attribute controls upstream VLAN tagging. Valid values are:
operation mode:         0     Upstream frame is sent as is, regardless of tag.
                        1     The upstream frame is tagged, whether or not the received frame
                              was tagged. The frame's TCI, consisting of VID, CFI and user
                              priority, is attached or overwritten with the upstream VLAN tag
                              TCI value.
                        2     The upstream frame is prepended with a tag, whether or not the
                              received frame was tagged. If the received frame is tagged, a
                              second tag (Q-in-Q) is added to the frame. If the received frame is
                              not tagged, a tag is attached to the frame. The added tag is defined
                              by the upstream VLAN tag TCI value attribute.
                        (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Upstream VLAN tag TCI This attribute specifies the TCI for upstream VLAN tagging. It is used
value:                  when the upstream VLAN tagging operation mode is 1 or 2. (R, W,
                        Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Downstream VLAN         This attribute controls downstream VLAN tagging. Valid values are:
tagging operation mode: 0     Downstream frame is sent as is, regardless of tag.
                        1     If the received frame is tagged, the outer tag is stripped. An
                              untagged frame is forwarded unchanged.
                        (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Association type:       This attribute specifies the type of the ME that is associated with this
                        VLAN tagging operation configuration data ME. Values are assigned
                        in accordance with the following list:
                        0     (Default) Physical path termination point Ethernet UNI (for
                              backward compatibility, may also be an IP host config data ME;
                              they must not have the same ME ID). The associated ME instance
                              is implicit; its identifier is the same as that of this VLAN tagging
                              operation configuration data.
                        1     IP host config data.
                        2     802.1p mapper service profile.
                        3     MAC bridge port configuration data.
                        4     Physical path termination point xDSL UNI.
                        5     GEM interworking termination point.
                        6     Multicast GEM interworking termination point.
                        7     Physical path termination point MoCA UNI.
                        8     Physical path termination point 802.11 UNI.
                        9     Ethernet flow termination point.
                        10 Physical path termination point Ethernet UNI.
                        The associated ME instance is identified by the associated ME pointer.
                        (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
                             the ME with which this VLAN tagging operation configuration data
                             ME is associated. Otherwise, this attribute is undefined, and the
                             association is implicit.
                             NOTE – When the association type is xDSL, the two most significant bits
                             may be used to indicate a bearer channel.

9.3.13 Extended VLAN tagging operation configuration data
This managed entity organizes data associated with VLAN tagging. Regardless of its point of
attachment, the specified tagging operations refer to the upstream direction. Instances of this
managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
Zero or one instance(s) of this managed entity may exist for an instance of any managed entity that
can terminate or modify an Ethernet stream. By definition, tagging operation occurs farther away
from the MAC bridge than filtering.
Attributes
Managed entity id:           This attribute provides a unique number for each instance of this
                             managed entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Association type:            This attribute identifies the type of the ME associated with this
                             extended VLAN tagging ME. Values are assigned as follows:
                             0     MAC bridge port configuration data.
                             1     802.1p mapper service profile.
                             2     Physical path termination point Ethernet UNI.
                             3     IP host config data.
                             4     Physical path termination point xDSL UNI.
                             5     GEM interworking termination point.
                             6     Multicast GEM interworking termination point.
                             7     Physical path termination point MoCA UNI.
                             8     Physical path termination point 802.11 UNI.
                             9     Ethernet flow termination point.
                             (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Received frame VLAN          This attribute indicates the maximum number of VLAN tagging
tagging operation table      operation entries that can be set in the received frame VLAN tagging
max size:                    operation table. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Input TPID:                  This attribute gives the special TPID value for operations on the input
                             (filtering) side of the table. Typical values include 0x88a8 and 0x9100.
                             (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Output TPID:                 This attribute gives the special TPID value for operations on the output
                             (tagging) side of the table. Typical values include 0x88a8 and 0x9100.
                             (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Downstream mode:         Regardless of its association, the extended VLAN tagging operation
                         configuration data ME pertains to upstream traffic. This attribute
                         specifies the mode for downstream mapping:
                         0     The operation performed in the downstream direction is the
                               inverse of that performed in the upstream direction. For
                               one-to-one VLAN mappings, the inverse is trivially defined.
                               Many-to-one mappings are possible, however, and these are
                               treated as follows. If the many-to-one mapping results from
                               multiple operation rules producing the same ANI-side tag
                               configuration, then the first rule in the list defines the inverse
                               operation. If the many-to-one mapping results from "do not care"
                               fields in the filter being replaced with provisioned fields in the
                               ANI-side tags, then the inverse is defined to set the corresponding
                               fields on the ANI-side with their lowest value.
                         1     No operation is performed in the downstream direction.
                         All other values are reserved. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Received frame VLAN      This attribute is a table that filters and tags upstream frames. Each
tagging operation table: entry represents a tagging rule, comprising a filtering part (the first
                         7 fields) and a treatment part (the last 7 fields). Each incoming
                         upstream packet is matched against each rule in list order. The first rule
                         that matches the packet is selected as the active rule, and the packet is
                         then treated according to that rule.
                         There are three categories of rules: zero-tag, single-tag, and double-tag
                         rules. Logically, these categories are separate, and apply to their
                         respective incoming frame types. In other words, a single-tag rule
                         should not apply to a double-tagged frame, even though the single-tag
                         rule might match the outer tag of the double-tagged frame.
                         Single-tag rules have a filter outer priority field = 15 (indicating no
                         external tag), zero-tag rules have both filter priority fields = 15
                         (indicating no tags), and double-tag rules have both filter priority fields
                         set to a value that is different from 15 (indicating two tags).
                         Each tagging rule is based on 'remove' and 'add' operation, where up to
                         two tags can be removed or added. A modify operation is applied by
                         the combination of 'remove' and 'add'.
                         Note that when a single tag is added, the treatments use the 'inner tag'
                         data-fields for definiteness – this is true even for treatments where a
                         single tag is added to a frame that already has a tag, i.e., added as a
                         second tag. The 'outer tag' data-fields are used only when two tags are
                         added by the same rule.
                         The terms 'inner' and 'outer' only have meaning with respect to the tags
                         that are being filtered or added.
                         One set operation can add, modify or delete one entry. The first 8 bytes
                         of each entry are guaranteed to be unique, and are used to identify table
                         entries (list order, above, refers to a sort on the first 8 bytes). The OLT
                         deletes a table entry by setting its last eight bytes to all 0xFF.
                                     When the table is created, the ONT should predefine three entries that
                                     list the default treatment (of normal forwarding) for untagged,
                                     single-tagged, and double-tagged frames. As an exception to the rule
                                     on ordered processing, these default rules are always considered as a

9.3.14 Dot1X port extension package
An instance of this managed entity represents a set of attributes that control a port's
[b-IEEE 802.1X] operation. It is created and deleted autonomously by the ONT upon creation or
deletion of a PPTP that supports 802.1X authentication.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with a physical path termination point that
performs IEEE 802 authentication (i.e., Ethernet or DSL).
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute provides a unique number for each instance of this
                            managed entity. Its value is the same as that of its associated physical
                            path termination point (i.e., slot and port number).
                            NOTE – When the associated port is xDSL, the two most significant bits may
                            be used to indicate a bearer channel. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Dot1x enable:               If set true, this Boolean attribute forces the associated port to
                            authenticate via [b-IEEE 802.1X] as a precondition of normal service.
                            The default value false does not impose 802.1X authentication on the
                            associated port. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Action register:            This attribute defines a set of actions that can be performed on the
                            associated port. The act of writing to the register causes the specified
                            action.
                            1)    Force reauthentication: This opcode initiates an 802.1X
                                  reauthentication conversation with the associated port. The port
                                  remains in its currently authorized state until the conversation
                                  concludes.
                            2)    Force unauthenticated: This opcode initiates an 802.1X
                                  authentication conversation whose outcome is predestined to fail,
                                  thereby disabling normal Ethernet service on the port. The port's
                                  provisioning is not changed, such that upon reinitialization, a
                                  new 802.1X conversation may restore service without prejudice.
                            3)    Force authenticated: This opcode initiates an 802.1X
                                  authentication conversation whose outcome is predestined to
                                  succeed, thereby unconditionally enabling normal Ethernet
                                  service on the port. The port's provisioning is not changed, such
                                  that upon reinitialization, a new 802.1X conversation is required.
                            (W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Authenticator PAE state: This attribute returns the value of the port's PAE state. States are
                           further described in [b-IEEE 802.1X]. Values are coded as shown
                           below:
                           0     Initialize.
                           1     Disconnected.
                           2     Connecting.
                           3     Authenticating.
                           4     Authenticated.
                           5     Aborting.
                           6     Held.
                           7     Force auth.
                           8     Force unauth.
                           9     Restart.
                           (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Backend authentication     This attribute returns the value of the port's back-end authentication
state:                     state. States are further described in [b-IEEE 802.1X]. Values are
                           coded as shown below:
                           0     Request.
                           1     Response.
                           2     Success.
                           3     Fail.
                           4     Timeout.
                           5     Idle.
                           6     Initialize.
                           7     Ignore.
                           (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Admin controlled           This attribute controls the directionality of the port's authentication
directions:                requirement. The default value 0 indicates that control is imposed in
                           both directions. The value 1 indicates that control is imposed only on
                           traffic from the subscriber toward the network. (R, W) (optional)
                           (1 byte)
Operational controlled     This attribute indicates the actual directionality of the port's
directions:                authentication. The value 0 indicates that control is imposed in both
                           directions. The value 1 indicates that control is imposed only on traffic
                           from the subscriber toward the network. (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Authenticator controlled This read-only attribute indicates whether the controlled port is
port status:               currently authorized (1) or unauthorized (2). (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Quiet period:              This attribute specifies the interval between EAP request/identity
                           invitations sent to the peer. Other events such as carrier present or
                           EAPOL start frames from the peer may trigger an EAP request/identity
                           frame from the ONT at any time; this attribute controls the ONT's
                           periodic behaviour in the absence of these other inputs. It is expressed
                           in seconds. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
                              the radius server before timing out. Within this maximum interval, the
                              ONT may initiate several retransmissions with exponentially
                              increasing delay. Upon timeout, the ONT may try another radius server
                              if there is one, or invoke the fallback policy, if no alternate radius
                              servers are available. Server timeout is expressed in seconds, with a
                              default value of 30 and a maximum value of 65535 seconds. (R, W)
                              (optional) (2 bytes)
Reauthentication period: This attribute records the reauthentication interval specified by the
                              radius authentication server. It is expressed in seconds. The attribute is
                              only meaningful after a port has been authenticated. (R) (optional)
                              (2 bytes)
Reauthentication enabled: This Boolean attribute records whether the radius authentication server
                              has enabled reauthentication on this service (true) or not (false). The
                              attribute is only meaningful after a port has been authenticated. (R)
                              (optional) (1 byte)
Key transmission enabled: This Boolean attribute indicates whether key transmission is enabled
                              (true) or not (false). This feature is not required; the parameter is listed
                              here for completeness vis-à-vis [b-IEEE 802.1X]. (R, W) (optional)

Circuit ID prefix:           This attribute is a pointer to a large string managed entity whose
                             content appears as the prefix of the NAS port ID in radius
                             access-request messages. The remainder of the NAS port ID field is
                             local information (for example slot-port, appended by the ONT itself).
                             The default value of this attribute is the null pointer 0. (R, W)

                             Ethernet service is provided. The default value 0 causes 802.1X
                             conversations to succeed when no external authentication server is
                             accessible. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Auth server 1:               This attribute is a pointer to a large string managed entity that contains
                             the URI of the first choice radius authentication server. The value 0
                             indicates that no radius authentication server is specified. (R, W)

9.3.19 Dot1ag maintenance domain
A maintenance domain (MD) is a context within which CFM connectivity verification can occur.
Individual services (maintenance associations: MAs) exist within an MD. A maintenance domain is
created and deleted by the OLT. The MD managed entity is specified by [b-IEEE 802.1ag] in such a
way that the same provisioning can be used for all associated systems in a network; the OMCI
definition accordingly avoids ONT-specific information such as pointers.
Relationships
Several MDs may be associated with a given bridge, at various MD levels, and a given MD may be
associated with any number of bridges.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies an instance of this managed entity.
                              The values 0 and 0xFFFF are reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)

                         value is the left-justified maintenance domain name. The MD name
                         may or may not be a printable character string, so an octet string is the
                         appropriate representation. If the MD name format specifies a
                         DNS-like name or a character string, the string is null-terminated;
                         otherwise its length is determined by the MD name format. If the MD
                         has no name (MD name format = 0), this attribute is undefined. Note
                         that binary comparisons of the MD name are made in other CFM state
                         machines, so blanks, alphabetic case, etc., are significant. Further note
                         that the maintenance domain name and the maintenance association
                         name must be packed (with additional bytes) into 48-byte CFM
                         message headers. (R, W) (mandatory if MD name format is not 1)

MHF creation:            This attribute determines whether an associated bridge creates an MHF
                         for this MD or not, under circumstances defined in clause 22.2.3 of
                         [b-IEEE 802.1ag]. This attribute is an enumeration with the following
                         values:
                         1    None, the default value.
                         2    Default. The bridge can create MHFs on an associated VID on any
                              port through which the VID can pass, where: i) there are no lower
                              active MD levels or ii) there is a MEP at the next lower active MD
                              level on the port.
                         3    Explicit. The bridge can create MHFs on an associated VID on any
                              port through which the VID can pass, but only if a MEP exists at
                              some lower maintenance level.

Sender ID permission:    This attribute determines the content of the sender ID TLV included in
                         CFM messages transmitted by maintenance points controlled by this
                         MD. Chassis ID and management address information is available
                         from the dot1ag chassis-management info managed entity. The
                         attribute is an enumeration with the following values:
                         1    None: The sender ID TLV is not to be sent, default.
                         2    Chassis: The chassis ID length, chassis ID subtype, and chassis ID
                              fields of the sender ID TLV are to be sent, but not the management
                              address fields.

This managed entity models an IEEE 802.1 service defined on a bridge port. A maintenance
association (MA) is a set of endpoints on opposite sides of a network, all existing at a defined
maintenance level. One of the endpoints resides on the local ONT; the others are understood to be
configured in a consistent way on external equipments. [b-ITU-T Y.1731] refers to the MA as a
maintenance entity group (MEG).
A maintenance association is created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
Any number of MAs may be associated with a given maintenance domain, or may stand on their
own without an MD. One or more MAs may be associated with a MAC bridge or 802.1p mapper.
An MA exists at one of eight possible maintenance levels.

MA name 2:                    the left-justified maintenance association name. Because the MA name
                              may or may not be a printable character string, an octet string is the
                              appropriate representation. If the short MA name format specifies a

Associated VLANs:     This attribute is a list of up to 12 VLAN IDs with which this MA is
                      associated. Once a set of VLANs is defined, the ONT should deny
                      operations to other dot1ag maintenance associations or dot1ag default
                      MD level entries that conflict with the set membership. The all-zeros
                      value indicates that this MA is not associated with any VLANs.
                      Assuming that the attribute is not 0, the first entry is understood to be
                      the primary VLAN. Except forwarded LTMs, CFM messages emitted
                      by maintenance points in this MA are tagged with the primary VLAN

                          through which the VID can pass, but only if a MEP exists at some
                          lower maintenance level.
                      4   Defer. This value causes the ONT to use the setting of the parent

9.3.21 Dot1ag default MD level
An MHF is a collection of functionality that is not explicitly modelled as a managed entity by either
[b-IEEE 802.1ag] or OMCI. The ONT automatically creates MHFs according to parameters
specified in a dot1ag maintenance domain or a dot1ag maintenance association ME; the dot1ag
default MD level ME catches the corner cases not covered by other MEs, specifically VLANs not
included by any defined MA.
The dot1ag default MD level comprises a configurable table, each entry of which specifies default
MHF functionality for some set of VLANs. Once a set of VLANs is defined, operations to different
table entries or to dot1ag maintenance associations that conflict with the set membership should be
denied. In addition, catch-all attributes are defined to specify MHF functionality when there is no
match to either a table entry or an MA.
Relationships
An ONT that supports [b-IEEE 802.1ag] automatically creates one instance of this ME for each
MAC bridge or 802.1p mapper, depending on the ONT's provisioning model. It should not create an
instance for an 802.1p mapper that is associated with a MAC bridge.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies an instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of the MAC bridge service profile ME or an 802.1p mapper
                              ME. It is expected that an ONT will implement CFM on bridges or on
                              802.1p mappers, but not both, depending on its provisioning model.
                              For precision, the reference is disambiguated by the value of the layer
                              2 type pointer attribute. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Layer 2 type:                 This attribute specifies whether the dot1ag default MD level ME is
                              associated with a MAC bridge service profile (value 0) or an 802.1p
                              mapper (value 1). (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Catchall level:               This attribute ranges from 0..7 and specifies the MD level of MHFs

                        enumeration with the following values:
                        1   None; the bridge creates no MHFs. This is the default value.
                        2   Default. The bridge can create MHFs on this VID on any port
                            through which the VID can pass.
                        3   Explicit. The bridge can create MHFs on this VID on any port
                            through which the VID can pass, but only if a MEP exists at some

permission:             CFM messages transmitted by maintenance points when no more
                        specific match is found. This attribute is identical to that defined in the
                        description of the dot1ag maintenance domain managed entity (i.e.,
                        excluding codepoint 5, defer). (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)

                        the same VID and MD level as this table's entry, and on which an up
                        MEP is defined. This attribute is read-only. Space should be allocated
                        for it during set operations, but the value is not used. (1 byte)

                        additional value 0xFF instructs the bridge to use the value in the
                        catchall level attribute. (1 byte)
MHF creation:           This attribute determines whether the bridge creates an MHF or not,
                        under circumstances defined in clause 22.2.3 of [b-IEEE 802.1ag].
                        This attribute is an enumeration with the following values (1 byte):
                        1   None; no MHFs are created on this bridge for this MA.
                        2   Default. The bridge can create MHFs on this VID on any port
                            through which the VID can pass.
                        3   Explicit. The bridge can create MHFs on this VID on any port
                            through which the VID can pass, but only if a MEP exists at some

                                MHF creation attribute. This is recommended to be the default
                                value.
Sender ID permission:       This attribute determines the content of the sender ID TLV included in
                            CFM messages transmitted by maintenance points controlled by this
                            MA. (1 byte)

                                to be sent, but the chassis ID length is to be transmitted with a 0
                                value, and the chassis ID subtype, and chassis ID fields are not to
                                be sent.
                            4   ChassisManage: All chassis ID and management address fields are

9.3.22 Dot1ag MEP
This managed entity models a maintenance association end point (MEP) as defined primarily in
[b-IEEE 802.1ag] and secondarily in [b-ITU-T Y.1731]. It is created and deleted by the OLT. A
MEP exists at one of eight possible maintenance levels, and resides at the boundary of a
maintenance domain. It inherits a name, and optionally a set of associated VLANs, from its
associated MA.
Relationships
One or more MEPs may be associated with a MAC bridge port or an 802.1p mapper in the absence
of a MAC bridge. A MEP is also associated with zero or more VLANs and a maintenance
association.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.

Layer 2 entity pointer:     Depending on the value of the layer 2 type attribute, this pointer
                            specifies the MAC bridge port configuration data ME or the 802.1p
                            mapper service profile ME with which this MEP is associated. (R, W,

MA pointer:                 This pointer specifies the maintenance association (MA) with which
                            this MEP is associated. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
MEP ID:                     This attribute specifies the MEP's own identity in the MA. For a given
                            MA, the MEP ID must be unique throughout the network defined by
                            the MD. The MEP ID is defined in the range 1..8191. The default value
                            0 indicates that no MEP ID is (yet) configured. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
MEP control:                This attribute specifies some of the overall behavioural aspects of the
                            MEP. It is interpreted as follows. Ethernet AIS generation should not
                            be enabled simultaneously with CCMs.

Primary VLAN:               This attribute is a 12-bit VLAN ID. The value 0 indicates that the MEP
                            inherits its primary VLAN from its parent MA. CFM messages, except
                            forwarded LTMs, are tagged with the primary VLAN ID. If explicitly
                            specified, the value of this attribute must be one of the VLANs
                            associated with the parent MA. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)

Administrative state:       This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
                            managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all
                            functions are blocked, and alarms for this managed entity are no longer
                            generated. Because spurious alarms may be generated during the
                            process of configuring CFM across a network, the default value for this
                            attribute is locked. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
CCM and LTM priority: By default, CCM and LTM frames are transmitted with the highest
                            Ethernet priority available. Ranging from 0..7, this attribute permits
                            these frames to be explicitly prioritized, which may be needed if flows
                            are separated, e.g., by 802.1p priority. The priority specified in this
                            attribute is also used in LTR frames originated by this MEP. (R, W,

                               this field is 0 (default), the ONT uses the MEP's MAC address, with 0
                               as the locally-defined identifier. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)

Peer MEP IDs:                  This attribute lists the expected peer MEPs for CCMs, 2 bytes per MEP
                               ID. [b-IEEE 802.1ag] allows for multipoint networks, and therefore a
                               list of peer MEPs. This attribute allows for up to 12 peers for a given
                               MEP, though G-PON applications are expected to need only a single
                               peer. Missing or unexpected messages trigger alarm declaration after a
                               soak interval. Unused peer MEP slots should be set to 0. (R, W)

ETH AIS control:               This attribute controls the generation of Ethernet AIS frames when
                               they are enabled through the MEP control attribute. It is interpreted as
                               follows:

Fault alarm threshold:         This attribute specifies the lowest priority alarm that is allowed to
                               generate a fault alarm. It is defined as follows:
                               1     All defects generate alarms after suitable soaking, including AIS
                                     and RDICCM.
                               2     Alarm generated only by one of: MACstatus, RemoteCCM,
                                     ErrorCCM, XconCCM. This value is recommended as the default
                                     in [b-IEEE 802.1ag].
                               3     Alarm generated only by one of: RemoteCCM, ErrorCCM,
                                     XconCCM.
                               4     Alarm generated only by one of: ErrorCCM, XconCCM.
                               5     Alarm generated only by: XconCCM.
                               6     No alarms are to be reported. This setting may be useful during
                                     configuration of services across the network when spurious alarms
                                     could otherwise be generated.

time:                          MEP declares an alarm. It is expressed in ten-millisecond units with a
                               range of 250 to 1000, i.e., 2.5 to 10 seconds. The default is
                               recommended to be 2.5 seconds. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Alarm clear soak time:         This attribute defines the defect-free soak time that must elapse before
                               the MEP clears an alarm. It is expressed in ten-millisecond units with a
                               range of 250 to 1000, i.e., 2.5 to 10 seconds. The default is
                               recommended to be 10 seconds. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)

Test:                          The test operation causes the MEP to originate one or more loopback
                               messages (LBMs) or a linktrace message (LTM) in accordance with
                               the message format defined in clause II.2.27.
The link trace test returns its results in a general purpose buffer ME, which must have been created
in advance by the OLT. Upon completion of the linktrace operation, the general purpose buffer
contains a sequence of LTR entries in the order they were received:
            Length field, 2 bytes                                      Length bytes
              Length of LTR1                  LTR: link trace reply 1 (clause 21.9 of [b-IEEE 802.1ag])
              Length of LTR2                  LTR: link trace reply 2
                    Etc.
[b-IEEE 802.1ag] defines the data structure for the linktrace database in detail, but the definition is
essentially the same as the LTR PDU itself. OMCI simply records the messages for parsing and
analysis at the OLT or the EMS.
If the ONT cannot allocate enough memory for the entire list, it keeps the most recent responses and
discards the older LTRs as necessary (LTR1, LTR2, …).

9.3.23 Dot1ag MEP status
This managed entity is the read-only twin of the dot1ag MEP. Its purpose is to return information
that may help in system- or network-level troubleshooting. It is automatically created and deleted
by the ONT at the time its MEP is created or deleted.
As the reporter of ephemeral information, the dot1ag MEP status ME is not persistent and is not
included in MIB uploads.

Notifications
None. This managed entity does not generate AVCs because its attributes change frequently in real
time, but are generally only of interest after the corresponding MEP declares an alarm.
This managed entity records the recent history of remote MEPs, as deduced by the local parent
MEP. Because records are of variable length, and are constantly updated, a separate attribute is
defined for each remote MEP. The dot1ag MEP CCM database is automatically created or deleted
by the ONT at the time a MEP is created or deleted.
As the reporter of ephemeral information, the dot1ag MEP CCM database ME is not persistent and
is not included in MIB uploads.

                            information for one of the possible remote MEPs. It is expected that
                            there will be only one remote MEP per MA in G-PON applications, but
                            the ME is defined in a way that permits several RMEPs. The optional
                            attributes are instantiated by the ONT when additional remote MEPs
                            are provisioned on the local MEP. Remote MEP records appear in no
                            particular order, and the order is not guaranteed to persist across ONT

9.3.25 Dot1ag CFM stack
This managed entity reports the maintenance status of a bridge's port at any given time. An ONT
that supports [b-IEEE 802.1ag] functionality automatically creates an instance of the dot1ag CFM
stack ME for each MAC bridge or 802.1p mapper, depending on its provisioning model.
The dot1ag CFM stack also lists any VLANs and bridge ports against which configuration errors
are currently identified. The ONT should reject operations that create configuration errors.
However, these errors can arise because of operations on other MEs that are not necessarily possible
to detect during CFM configuration.
An ONT that supports [b-IEEE 802.1ag] creates one instance of this ME for each MAC bridge or
802.1p mapper, depending on its provisioning model. It should not create an instance for an 802.1p
mapper that is associated with a MAC bridge.
Attributes
Managed entity id:           This attribute uniquely identifies an instance of this managed entity.
                             Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                             instance of the MAC bridge service profile ME or an 802.1p mapper
                             ME. It is expected that an ONT will implement CFM on bridges or on
                             802.1p mappers, but not both. For precision, the reference is
                             disambiguated by the value of the layer 2 type pointer attribute. (R)

Layer 2 type:                This attribute specifies whether the dot1ag CFM stack is associated
                             with a MAC bridge service profile (value 0) or an 802.1p mapper
                             (value 1). (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
MP status table:             This attribute is a list of entries, each entry reporting one aspect of the
                             maintenance status of one port. If a port is associated with more than
                             one CFM maintenance entity, each is represented as a separate item in
                             this table attribute; a port that has no current maintenance functions is
                             not represented in the table (so the table may be empty). Each entry is
                             defined as follows:

                             of its MEP ID (range 1..8191). If this table entry reports an MHF, this
                             field contains the value 0. (2 bytes)

9.3.26 Dot1ag chassis-management info
This managed entity represents the system-level chassis ID and/or management address for
[b-IEEE 802.1ag] CFM messages, and potentially for other 802-based functions. Although
[b-IEEE 802.1AB] allows for several management addresses (synonyms in different formats, or
with granularity to the component level), [b-IEEE 802.1ag] does not provide for more than one. Nor
provides for only one.
According to sender ID permission attributes in several dot1ag managed entities, transmitted
[b-IEEE 802.1ag] CFM messages may include either or both of the chassis ID or management
address fields. [b-IEEE 802.1ag] requires that CCMs not exceed 128 bytes, of which 74 are
separately allocated to other purposes; the sender ID TLV, if present, must accommodate this
requirement. The chassis info and management info must fit, with a minimum of 4 additional
overhead bytes, into the remaining 54 bytes. This limit is exploited in defining the maximum size of
the managed entity's attributes.
Relationships
If an ONT supports [b-IEEE 802.1ag] functionality, it automatically creates an instance of this
managed entity.
Attributes

                              groups that are not listed in this table.
                              Each list entry is a vector of eight components:
                              –    Table index (2 bytes)
                                   The first two bytes of each entry are treated as the index of the
                                   table. It is the responsibility of the OLT to assign and track table
                                   indices and content. The ONT should deny set operations that
                                   create range overlaps.
                                   The two MSBs of this field determine the meaning of a set
                                   operation. These bits are returned as 00 during get next operations.
   Bits 16..15                                             Meaning
        00        Reserved.
        01        Write this entry into the table. Overwrite any existing entry with the same table index.
        10        Delete this entry from the table. The remaining fields are not meaningful.
        11        Clear all entries from the table. The remaining fields are not meaningful.
                              –     GEM port-ID (2 bytes)
                              –     VLAN ID. This field specifies the VLAN carrying the multicast
                                    group downstream. The VLAN ID resides in the 12 least
                                    significant bits; the remaining bits are set to 0 and not used. The
                                    value 0x0000 designates an untagged downstream flow. (2 bytes)
                              –     Source IP address. The value 0.0.0.0 specifies that source IP
                                    address is to be ignored. (4 bytes)
                              –     Destination IP address of the start of the multicast range. (4 bytes)
                              –     Destination IP address of the end of the multicast range. (4 bytes)
                              –     Imputed group bandwidth. Expressed in bytes per second, the
                                    imputed group bandwidth is used to decide whether or not to
                                    honour a join request in the presence of a max multicast bandwidth
                                    limit. The default value 0 effectively allows this table entry to
                                    avoid max bandwidth limitations. (4 bytes)
                              –     Reserved, set to 0. (2 bytes)
                              A single multicast group may be specified by setting start and end
                              destination IP addresses to the same value.
                              (R, W) (mandatory) (24N bytes, where N is the number of entries in the
                              table)
Discussion of table size:     While theoretically, this table could contain 16,384 entries, real-world
                              applications are not expected to require large tables. It is instead
                              anticipated that the table will list a moderate number of contiguous
                              ranges, each of which shares a common GEM port, VLAN, IP source
                              and imputed bandwidth.
Static access control list    This attribute is a list that specifies one or more multicast group address
table:                        ranges. Groups defined in this list are multicast on the associated
                              UNI(s) unconditionally, that is, without the need for an IGMP join. The
                              bandwidth of static multicast groups is not included in the current
                              multicast bandwidth measurement maintained by the multicast
                              subscriber monitor managed entity. If a join message is always
                              expected, this table may be empty. Table entries have the same format
                              as those in the dynamic access control list table. (R, W) (mandatory)
                              (24N bytes, where N is the number of entries in the table)
Lost groups list table:       This attribute is a list of groups from the dynamic access control list
                              table for which there is an active join, but no downstream flow is
                              present, possibly because of source failure, but also possibly because of
                              misconfiguration somewhere upstream. After a join, the ONT should
                              wait a reasonable time for upstream processing before declaring a group
                              to be lost. Each entry is a vector of the following components:
                              –    VLAN ID, 0 if not used. (2 bytes)
                              –    Source IP address, 0.0.0.0 if not used. (4 bytes)
                              –    Multicast destination IP address. (4 bytes)
                              (R) (optional) (10N bytes)
Robustness:                   This attribute allows tuning for possible packet loss in the network. The
                              default value 0 causes the ONT to follow the IETF recommendation to
                              copy the robustness value from query messages originating further
                              upstream. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
Querier IP address:           This attribute specifies the IP address to be used by a proxy querier.
                              Although it is not a legitimate IP address, the default value 0.0.0.0 is
                              legal in this case (see [b-IETF RFC 4541]). (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (optional) (4 bytes)
Query interval:               This attribute specifies the interval between general queries in seconds.
                              The default is 125 seconds. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (4 bytes)
Query max response time: This attribute is the max response time added by the proxy into general
                              query messages directed to UNIs. It is expressed in tenths of seconds,
                              with a default of 100 (10 seconds). (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional)
                              (4 bytes)
Last member query             This attribute specifies the max response time inserted into
interval:                     group-specific queries sent to UNIs in response to group leave
                              messages. It is also the repetition rate of [robustness] transmissions of
                              the query. It is specified in tenths of seconds, with a default of 10 (1
                              second). (R, W) (optional) (4 bytes)

9.3.28 Multicast subscriber config info
This managed entity organizes data associated with multicast management at subscriber ports of
802.1 bridges, including 802.1p mappers when the provisioning model is mapper-based rather than
bridge-based. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT. Because of
backward compatibility considerations, a subscriber port without an associated multicast subscriber
config info ME would be expected to support unrestricted multicast access; this ME may therefore
be viewed as restrictive, rather than permissive.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with one instance of the MAC bridge port
configuration data or the 802.1p mapper service profile.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of the MAC bridge port configuration data or 802.1p mapper
                              ME. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ME type:                      This attribute indicates the type of the ME implicitly linked by the
                              managed entity id attribute.

Multicast operations          This attribute points to an instance of the multicast operations profile.
profile pointer:              (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Max simultaneous groups: This attribute specifies the maximum number of dynamic multicast
                              groups that may be replicated to the client port at any one time. The
                              default value 0 specifies that no administrative limit is to be imposed.
                              (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (2 bytes)
Max multicast bandwidth: This attribute specifies the maximum imputed dynamic bandwidth, in
                              bytes per second, that may be delivered to the client port at any one
                              time. The default value 0 specifies that no administrative limit is to be
                              imposed. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (4 bytes)
Bandwidth enforcement:        The default value of this Boolean attribute is false, and specifies that
                              attempts to exceed the max multicast bandwidth be counted but
                              honoured. The value true specifies that such attempts be counted and
                              denied. The imputed bandwidth value is taken from the dynamic access
                              control list table, both for a new join request and for pre-existing
                              groups. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)

9.3.29 Multicast subscriber monitor
This managed entity provides the current status of each port with respect to its multicast
subscriptions. It may be useful for status monitoring or debugging purposes. The status table
includes all groups currently subscribed by the port, both dynamic and static.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted at the request of the OLT. One instance
may exist for each 802.1 UNI configured to support multicast subscription.
Attributes
Managed entity id:           This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                             Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                             instance of the MAC bridge port configuration data or 802.1p mapper
                             ME. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ME type:                     This attribute indicates the type of the ME implicitly linked by the
                             managed entity id attribute.

bandwidth:                   currently being delivered over all dynamic multicast groups. (R)
                             (optional) (4 bytes)
Join messages counter:       This attribute counts the number of times the corresponding subscriber
                             sent a join message that was accepted. When full, the counter rolls over
                             to 0. (R) (optional) (4 bytes)
Bandwidth exceeded           This attribute counts the number of join messages that did, or would
counter:                     have, exceeded the max multicast bandwidth, whether accepted or
                             denied. When full, the counter rolls over to 0. (R) (optional) (4 bytes)
Active group list table:     This attribute lists the groups from the dynamic access control list table
                             that are currently being actively forwarded, along with the actual
                             bandwidth of each. If a join has been recognized from more than one IP
                             source address for a given group on this UNI, there will be one table
                             entry for each. Each table entry has the form:
                             –     VLAN ID, 0 if not used. (2 bytes)
                             –     Source IP address, 0.0.0.0 if not used. (4 bytes)

9.4.1     IP router service profile
This managed entity models an IP router as a whole. It organizes data that affects all ports on the
router. An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity may be associated with a real or virtual cardholder
(slot) that supports the router function. Any number of router ports may be associated with the
router through IP port config data MEs.
The router itself is configured and monitored through implicitly linked instances of the IP router
config data, IP route table, IP static routes and IP and ICMP PM history data MEs.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                    This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.

9.4.10 ARP service profile
This managed entity organizes data associated with the ARP function used by an IP router. The
OLT creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity upon the creation or deletion of the
corresponding instance of IP port configuration data of native LAN type.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with one instance of IP port configuration data of
native LAN type. The actual content of a port's ARP cache is visible through the implicitly linked
ARP configuration data ME.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the slot id
                            (defined in clause 9.1.5). It is 0 if the ONT is integrated. The second
                            byte is assigned by the OLT in the range 1..255. (R, Set-by-create)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ARP timer:                  This attribute reports the maximum number of seconds that IP packets
                            are held while they are awaiting address resolution by ARP at this port.
                            (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
ARP cache clear:            The Boolean value true initializes the associated ARP cache. The value
                            false has no significance. As the value of this attribute has no physical
                            meaning, the get action always returns the value false. (R, W)

9.4.12 IP host config data
The IP host config data configures IP-based services offered on the ONT. The ONT automatically
creates instances of this managed entity if IP host services are available.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with the ONT managed entity. Any number of
TCP/UDP MEs can point to the IP host config data, to model any number of ports and protocols.
Performance may be monitored through an implicitly linked IP host PM history data ME.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            The ONT creates as many instances as there are independent IP stacks
                            on the ONT. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)

9.5.1   Physical path termination point Ethernet UNI
This managed entity represents the point at an Ethernet UNI where the physical path terminates and
Ethernet physical level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•       When the ONT has Ethernet ports built into its factory configuration.
•       When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of Ethernet type.
•       When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of
        Ethernet type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence
        of Ethernet ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to
        instantiate a port mapping package that specifies Ethernet ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an Ethernet circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an Ethernet circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a preprovisioned or real
Ethernet port.
Attributes
Managed entity id:               This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                                 This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the UNI. The
                                 first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte is the
                                 port ID, with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Expected type:                   This attribute supports pre-provisioning. It is coded as follows:
                                 0            Autosense.
                                 1 to 254     One of the values from Table 9.1.5-1 that is compatible with
                                              an Ethernet circuit pack.
                                 Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                                 (mandatory) (1 byte)
Sensed type:              When a circuit pack is present, this attribute represents its type as one of
                          the values from Table 9.1.5-1. If the value of expected type is not 0, then
                          the value of sensed type should be the same as the value of expected
                          type. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. See also
                          the note in the notifications below.
                          (R) (mandatory if the ONT supports circuit packs with configurable
                          interface types, e.g., 10/100 BaseT card) (1 byte)

                                      transceiver. Loop 3 is depicted in Figure 9.5.1-5.
Note that normal bridge behaviour may defeat the loopback signal, unless broadcast MAC
addresses are used. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W) (mandatory)

Administrative state: This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
                      managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                      functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this
                      managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer
                      generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the
                      scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)

All 802.11 UNIs supported by an ONT are implicitly grouped together into an implied diversity
group. The model makes no provision to create more than one diversity group on a single ONT.
9.6.1     Physical path termination point 802.11 UNI
This managed entity models an 802.11 UNI, where physical paths terminate and physical path level
functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•         When the ONT has 802.11 ports built into its factory configuration.
•         When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of 802.11 type.
•         When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of 802.11
          type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of 802.11
          ports via equipment ID as well as type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a port
          mapping package that specifies 802.11 ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an 802.11 circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an 802.11 circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of an [IEEE 802.11] interface.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the UNI. The first
                          byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). If the UNI is integrated, this
                          value is 0. The second byte is the port ID, with range 1..255. (R)
                          (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Administrative state:     This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
                          managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                          functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this
                          managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer
                          generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the
                          scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:        This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable of
                          performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1). (R)
                          (optional) (1 byte)
dot11 supported data      This attribute specifies the set of data rates (maximum 8) at which the
rates tx:                 station is capable of transmitting data. Each octet contains a value
                          representing a rate. Each rate lies within the range 2..127, corresponding
                          to data rates in increments of 500 kbit/s from 1 Mbit/s to 63.5 Mbit/s. If
                          fewer than 8 data rates are specified, each of the unused bytes is set to 0.
                          (R) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
dot11 supported data      This attribute specifies the set of data rates (maximum 8) at which the
rates rx:                 station is capable of receiving data. Each octet contains a value
                          representing a rate. Each rate lies within the range 2..127, corresponding
                          to data rates in increments of 500 kbit/s from 1 Mbit/s to 63.5 Mbit/s. If
                          fewer than 8 data rates are specified, each of the unused bytes is set to 0.

Relationships
Up to four instances of this managed entity may exist for each instance of an [IEEE 802.11]
interface, one of each type. An instance contains one of the following [IEEE 802.11] data types:
WEP key mappings, group addresses, supported regulatory domains, and antennas list. Each use has
its own attributes, and a type attribute indicates which subset is active for each instance. Regardless
of which attributes are active, each attribute is numbered, in the OMCC attribute mask, according to
the ordering of the full attribute set indicated below.
For object types 0 and 1, the OLT may create and delete instances of this object. For object types 2
and 3, the ONT creates as many instances as required to model the UNI's capabilities.

9.6.5   802.11 MAC and PHY operation and antenna data
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this entity whenever it creates an instance of PPTP
802.11 UNI.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity exists for each [IEEE 802.11] interface.
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                            entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                            linked to an instance of the physical path termination point 802.11
                            UNI. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 MAC address:          Unique MAC address assigned to the STA. (R) (mandatory)
                            (6 bytes)
dot11 RTS threshold:        This attribute specifies the number of octets in an MPDU, at or
                            below which no RTS/CTS handshake is performed. An RTS/CTS
                            handshake is performed at the beginning of any frame exchange
                            sequence where the PDU is of type data or management, the MPDU
                            has an individual address in the address1 field, and the length of the
                            MPDU is greater than this threshold. Setting this attribute to be
                            larger than the maximum MSDU size has the effect of turning off the
                            RTS/CTS handshake for all data and management frames transmitted
                            by this STA. Setting this attribute to 0 has the effect of turning on the
                            RTS/CTS handshake for all data and management frames transmitted
                            by this STA. The default value of this attribute is 2347. (R, W)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 short retry limit:    This attribute specifies the maximum number of transmission
                            attempts of a frame whose length is less than or equal to dot11 RTS
                            threshold, before a failure condition is indicated. The default value of
                            this attribute is 7. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 long retry limit:     This attribute specifies the maximum number of transmission
                            attempts of a frame whose length is greater than dot11 RTS
                            threshold, before a failure condition is indicated. The default value of
                            this attribute is 4. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 fragmentation         This attribute specifies the maximum size, in octets, of the MPDU
threshold:                  that may be delivered to the PHY. An MSDU is broken into
                            fragments if its size exceeds the value of this attribute after adding
                            MAC headers and trailers. An MSDU or MMPDU is fragmented
                            when the resulting frame has an individual address in the address1
                            field, and the length of the frame is larger than this threshold. The
                            default value for this attribute is the lesser of 2346 or the aMPDU
                            max length of the attached PHY. The attribute value may never be
                            set to exceed this limit, and may never be less than 256. (R, W)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 max transmit MSDU The max transmit MSDU lifetime is the elapsed time in TU, from the
lifetime:                   initial transmission of an MSDU until further attempts to transmit it
                            are terminated. The default value of this attribute is 512. (R, W)
                            (mandatory) (4 bytes)
dot11 max receive lifetime: The max receive lifetime is the elapsed time in TU, from the initial
                            reception of a fragmented MMPDU or MSDU until further attempts
                            to reassemble the MMPDU or MSDU are terminated. The default
                            value is 512. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
                              PLCP and PMD. Currently defined values and their corresponding
                              PHY types are:
                              1 FHSS 2.4 GHz.

dot11 temp type:              There are different operating temperature requirements according to
                              anticipated environmental conditions. This attribute describes the
                              current PHY's operating temperature range capability. Currently
                              defined values and their corresponding temperature ranges are:

9.6.7    802.11 performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data for an instance of an 802.11 physical
path termination point. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
NOTE – This managed entity was formerly known by the name 802.11 counters.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of an [IEEE 802.11] interface.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                            entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                            linked to an instance of the physical path termination point 802.11
                            UNI. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:          This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute
                            interval. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:      This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                            entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                            attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                            Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 transmitted fragment This attribute counts acknowledged MPDUs with an individual

                            a STA in an ESS, where these frames are directed to the AP, this
                            implies having received an acknowledgment to all associated
                            MPDUs. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
dot11 failed count:         This attribute counts MSDUs that were not transmitted successfully
                            because the number of transmit attempts exceeded either the dot11
                            short retry limit or dot11 long retry limit, as specified in the
                            corresponding attributes of the associated 802.11 MAC and PHY

count:                           WEP subfield, is 1, when the WEPOn value for the key mapped to
                                 the TA's MAC address indicates that the frame should not have been
                                 encrypted. It also counts frames discarded because the receiving
                                 STA did not implement the privacy option. (R) (mandatory)

9.7.1   Physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 1
This managed entity represents the point where physical paths terminate on an xDSL CO modem
(xTU-C). The xDSL managed entity family is used for ADSL and VDSL2 services (an existing
legacy family of VDSL managed entities remains valid for [ITU-T G.993.1] VDSL. It is
documented in [ITU-T G.983.2]).
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•       When the ONT has xDSL ports built into its factory configuration.
•       When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of xDSL type.
•       When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of xDSL
        type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of xDSL
        ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
        port mapping package that specifies xDSL ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an xDSL circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an xDSL circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a real or preprovisioned
xDSL port.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                               entity. This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the
                               UNI. The six least significant bits of the first byte are the slot id,
                               defined in clause 9.1.5. The two most significant bits indicate the
                               channel number in some of the implicitly linked MEs, and must be 0
                               in the PPTP itself. This reduces the possible number of physical slots
                               to 64. The second byte is the port ID, with range 1..255. (R)
                               (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loopback configuration:        This attribute represents the loopback configuration of this physical
                               interface.
                               0   No loopback.
                               1   Loopback2 – A loopback at the ONT toward the OLT. The OLT
                                   can execute a physical level loopback test after loopback2 is set.
                               Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                               (mandatory) (1 byte)
Administrative state:          This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by
                               this managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all
                               user functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs
                               for this managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no
                               longer generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is
                               outside the scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory)
                               (1 byte)
Operational state:             This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable
                               of performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled
                               (1). (R) (optional) (1 byte)
xDSL line configuration        This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL line configuration
profile:                       profiles (part 1, 2 and 3) managed entities, and if [ITU-T G.993.2]
                               VDSL2 is supported, also to a VDSL2 line configuration extensions
                               ME. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0, a null
                               pointer. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
xDSL subcarrier masking        This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL subcarrier masking
downstream profile:            downstream profile managed entity. Upon ME instantiation, the
                               ONT sets this attribute to 0, a null pointer. (R, W) (mandatory)
                               (2 bytes)
xDSL subcarrier masking        This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL subcarrier masking

9.7.2     Physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 2
This managed entity represents the point in the ONT where physical paths terminate on an xDSL
CO modem (xTU-C). Standards and chip sets support several forms of DSL, including VDSL2, and
the xDSL managed entity family is used for all of them, with specific extensions for technology
variations (a legacy family of managed entities is documented in [ITU-T G.983.2] for
[ITU-T G.993.1] VDSL1).
The ONT creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity at the same time it creates or deletes
the corresponding PPTP xDSL UNI part 1.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a physical path termination
point xDSL UNI part 1.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                           This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this
                                             managed entity. Through an identical ID, this managed
                                             entity is implicitly linked to an instance of the physical
                                             path termination point xDSL UNI part 1. (R) (mandatory)

9.7.3    xDSL line configuration profile part 1
The overall xDSL line configuration profile is modelled in several parts, all of which are associated
together through a common managed entity id (the client physical path termination point xDSL UNI
part 1 has a single pointer, which refers to the entire set of line configuration profile parts).
Be aware that a number of attributes in the line configuration profile family affect the real-time
service delivery of an xDSL UNI, for example by triggering diagnostics. Despite the fact that they
are called profiles, it may be advisable to instantiate a complete set of these MEs for each PPTP
xDSL UNI.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                  entity. The value 0 is reserved. All xDSL and VDSL2 line
                                  configuration profiles that pertain to a given physical path
                                  termination point xDSL must share a common managed entity id.

xTU transmission system           This configuration attribute specifies the transmission system
enabling (xTSE):                  coding types to be allowed by the near-end xTU. It is a bit map as
                                  defined in Table 9.7.12-1.
                                  NOTE 1 – An additional byte enabling VDSL2 capabilities is defined in
                                  the VDSL2 transmission system enabling attribute of the xDSL line
                                  configuration profile part 2 managed entity.
                                  (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (7 bytes)
Power management state         This configuration parameter forces the line state of the near-end
forced:                        xTU. It is coded as an integer value with following definition:
                               0     Force the line from the L3 idle state to the L0 full-on state.
                                     This transition requires the short initialization procedures.
                                     After reaching the L0 state, the line may enter into or exit
                                     from the L2 low power state if the L2 state is enabled. If the
                                     L0 state is not reached after a vendor-discretionary number of
                                     retries and/or within a vendor-discretionary timeout, an
                                     initialization failure occurs. Whenever the line is in the L3
                                     state, it attempts to transition to the L0 state until it is forced
                                     into another state through this configuration parameter.
                               2     Force the line from the L0 full-on to L2 low power state. This
                                     is an out-of-service test value for triggering the L2 mode.
                               3     Force the line from the L0 full-on or L2 low power state to
                                     the L3 idle state. This transition requires the orderly
                                     shutdown procedure. After reaching the L3 state, the line
                                     remains there until it is forced into another state through this
                                     configuration parameter.

Power management state         This configuration parameter specifies the line states into which
enabling:                      the xTU-C or xTU-R may autonomously go. It is a bit map (0 if
                               not allowed, 1 if allowed) with the following definition:
                               Bit 1 (LSB):        L3 idle state.
                               Bit 2:              L1/L2 low power state.

                               downstream bearer channels, to successfully complete
                               initialization. Its value ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 310 (31.0 dB).

Upstream target noise margin: This attribute specifies the noise margin the xTU-C receiver must
                               achieve, relative to the BER requirement for each of the upstream
                               bearer channels, to successfully complete initialization. Its value
                               ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 310 (31.0 dB). (R, W, Set-by-create)

Downstream maximum noise This attribute specifies the maximum noise margin the xTU-R
margin:                        receiver tries to sustain. If the noise margin is above this level, the
                               xTU-R requests the xTU-C to reduce its transmit power, if this
                               functionality is supported. Its value ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 310
                               (31.0 dB). The special value 0xFFFF indicates that the maximum

Downstream minimum noise   This attribute specifies the minimum noise margin the xTU-R
margin:                    receiver must tolerate. If the noise margin falls below this level,
                           the xTU-R requests the xTU-C to increase its transmit power. If an
                           increase in xTU-C transmit power is not possible, a loss-of-margin
                           (LOM) defect occurs, the xTU-R fails and attempts to re-initialize,
                           and the PPTP declares a line initialization failure (LINIT) alarm.
                           Its value ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 310 (31.0 dB). (R, W,

Downstream rate adaptation This attribute specifies the mode of operation of a rate-adaptive
mode:                      xTU-C in the transmit direction. The parameter can take three
                           values.
                           1 Mode 1: MANUAL – Rate changed manually.
                                   At startup:
                                   The downstream minimum data rate parameter (see xDSL
                                   channel config profile) specifies the minimum required
                                   data rate for each downstream bearer channel, with a
                                   downstream noise margin that is at least as large as the
                                   specified downstream target noise margin, relative to the
                                   required BER for each of the downstream bearer channels.
                                   If the xTU-C fails to achieve the downstream minimum
                                   data rate for any of the bearer channels, the xTU-C fails to
                                   initialize and the PPTP declares a line initialization failure
                                   (LINIT) alarm. Although the xTU-C and the line might be
                                   able to support a higher data rate, the xTU-C does not
                                   transmit a higher data rate than is requested.
                                   At showtime:
                                   The xTU-C transmitter maintains the specified downstream
                                   minimum data rate for each of the bearer channels.
                           2 Mode 2: AT_INIT – Rate automatically selected at startup
                           only; rate does not change after that.
                                    At startup:
                                    The downstream minimum rate parameter specifies the
                                    minimum required data rate for each downstream bearer
                                    channel, with a downstream noise margin that is at least as
                                    large as the specified downstream target noise margin,
                                    relative to the required BER for each of the bearer
                                    channels. If the xTU-C fails to achieve the downstream
                                    minimum data rate for any of the bearer channels, the
                                    xTU-C fails to initialize and the PPTP declares a line
                                    initialization failure (LINIT) alarm. If the xTU-C
                                    transmitter is able to support a higher downstream data rate
                                    at initialization, the excess data rate is distributed among
                                    the downstream bearer channels according to the weight
                                    specified by the rate adaptation ratio parameter of each
                                    bearer channel. When the downstream maximum data rate
                                    is achieved in one of the bearer channels, the remaining
                                    excess rate is assigned to the other bearer channels, still
                                    according to their relative rate adaptation ratio parameters.
                                    As long as the downstream data rate is below the
                                    downstream maximum data rate for one of the bearer
                                    channels, data rate increase takes priority over transmit
                                    power reduction.
                                    At showtime:
                                    During showtime, no downstream data rate adaptation is
                                    allowed. The downstream data rate, determined during
                                    initialization for each bearer channel, is maintained.
                           3 Mode 3: DYNAMIC – Data rate is automatically selected at
                           initialization and is continuously adapted during showtime. The
                           dynamic rate adaptation mode is optional. All related
                           configuration parameters are also optional.
                                    At startup:
                                    The xTU-C starts up as in mode 2.
                                    At showtime:
                                    During showtime, rate adaptation is allowed according to
                                    the rate adaptation ratios for distributing the excess data
                                    rate amongst the bearer channels, as described in mode 2.
                                    The downstream data rate can vary between the
                                    downstream minimum data rate and the downstream
                                    maximum data rate. Downstream rate adaptation is
                                    performed when the conditions specified for downstream
                                    upshift noise margin and downstream upshift interval – or
                                    for downstream downshift noise margin and downstream
                                    downshift interval – are satisfied. This means:
                                    •      An upshift action is allowed when the downstream
                                           noise margin is above the downstream upshift noise
                                           margin during the downstream minimum time
                                           interval for upshift rate adaptation (i.e., upon RAU
                                           anomaly).
                                     •     A downshift action is allowed when the downstream
                                           noise margin is below the downstream downshift
                                           noise margin during the downstream minimum time
                                           interval for downshift rate adaptation (i.e., upon RAD
                                           anomaly).
                                     As long as the downstream data rate is below the
                                     downstream maximum data rate for one of the bearer
                                     channels, data rate increase takes priority over transmit
                                     power reduction.

Upstream rate adaptation     This attribute specifies the mode of operation of a rate-adaptive
mode:                        xTU-R in the transmit direction. The parameter is used only if
                             rate-adaptive functionality is supported. It can take three values:
                             1 MANUAL.

                             The definition of each of the values is identical to its definition in
                             the downstream rate adaptation mode (replacing xTU-C with
                             xTU-R and downstream with upstream). (R, W, Set-by-create)

                             xTU-R attempts to increase the downstream net data rate. This

9.7.4    xDSL line configuration profile part 2
The overall xDSL line configuration profile is modelled in several parts, all of which are associated
together through a common managed entity id (the client physical path termination point xDSL UNI
part 1 has a single pointer, which refers to the entire set of line configuration profile parts).
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                            entity. All xDSL and VDSL2 line configuration profiles that
                            pertain to a given physical path termination point xDSL must
                            share a common managed entity id. (R, Set-by-create)

Upstream maximum                This parameter specifies the maximum upstream aggregate receive
aggregate receive power:        power over a set of subcarriers, as defined in the relevant
                                Recommendation. The xTU-C requests an upstream power

9.7.5    xDSL line configuration profile part 3
The overall xDSL line configuration profile is modelled in several parts, all of which are associated
together through a common managed entity id (the client physical path termination point xDSL UNI
part 1 has a single pointer, which refers to the entire set of line configuration profile parts).
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                  entity. All xDSL and VDSL2 line configuration profiles that
                                  pertain to a given physical path termination point xDSL must
                                  share a common managed entity id. (R, Set-by-create)
                                  (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loop diagnostics mode forced This configuration parameter forces the line into loop diagnostic
(LDSF):                           mode via the xTU-C. It is only valid for [ITU-T G.992.3],
                                  [ITU-T G.992.4] and [ITU-T G.992.5]. It is defined as follows:
                                  0    Inhibits the xTU-C from performing loop diagnostic mode
                                       procedures on the line. Loop diagnostic mode procedures may
                                       still be initiated by the xTU-R.
                                  1    Forces the xTU-C to perform the loop diagnostics procedures.
                                  Only while the line power management state is L3 can the line be
                                  forced into loop diagnostic mode. When loop diagnostic
                                  procedures complete successfully, the ONT resets this attribute to
                                  0. The line remains in L3 idle state. The loop diagnostics data are
                                  available at least until the line is forced to the L0 state. As long as
                                  loop diagnostic procedures have not completed successfully,
                                  attempts are made to do so, until the loop diagnostic mode is no
                                  longer forced on the line through this configuration parameter. If
                                  loop diagnostic procedures cannot be completed successfully after
                                  a vendor-discretionary number of retries and/or within a
                                  vendor-discretionary timeout, then an initialization failure occurs.

Automode cold start forced:       This attribute is defined to improve testing of the performance of
                                  xTUs supporting automode. Valid values are 0 and 1. A change in
                                  value of this attribute indicates a change in loop conditions applied
                                  to the devices under test. The xTUs reset any historical
                                  information used for automode, for shortening G.994.1 handshake,
                                  or for shortening the initialization procedure.
                                  are enabled in xTSE Table 9.7.12-1 and where the selection of the
                                  operation mode to be used for transmission depends, not only on
                                  the common capabilities of both xTUs (as exchanged in
                                  [ITU-T G.994.1]), but also on achievable data rates under given
                                  loop conditions. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory if automode
                                  supported) (1 byte)
L2-ATPR:                          This parameter specifies the maximum aggregate transmit power
                                  reduction that can be performed in the L2 request (i.e., at the
                                  transition of L0 to L2 state) or through a single power trim in the
                                  L2 state. It is only valid for [ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.4]
                                  and [ITU-T G.992.5]. This attribute ranges from 0 (0 dB) dB to 31
                                  (31 dB). (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
L2-ATPRT:                         This parameter specifies the total maximum aggregate transmit
                                  power reduction (in dB) that can be performed in an L2 state. This
                                  is the sum of all reductions of L2 requests (i.e., at transitions from
                                  L0 to L2 state) and power trims. This attribute ranges from 0 (0
                                  dB) dB to 31 (31 dB). (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Force INP downstream:             When set to 1, this attribute forces the framer settings of all
                                  downstream bearer channels to be selected such that the impulse
                                  noise protection computed according to the formula specified in
                                  the relevant Recommendation is greater than or equal to the

9.7.6    VDSL2 line configuration extensions
This managed entity extends the xDSL line configuration MEs with attributes that are unique to
[ITU-T G.993.2] VDSL2. The attributes of this ME are further defined in [ITU-T G.997.1]. An
instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
The overall xDSL line configuration profile is modelled in several parts, all of which are associated
together through a common managed entity id (the client physical path termination point xDSL UNI

VDSL2 limit PSD        The LIMITMASK attribute contains the G.993.2 limit PSD masks of the
masks:                 selected PSD mask class, enabled by the near-end xTU for each class of

                       the xTSE (see Table 9.7.12-1).
                       The profiles are grouped in the following profile classes:
                          – Class 8: Profiles 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d.
                          – Class 12: Profiles 12a, 12b.

                       For each profile class, several limit PSD masks of the selected PSD mask
                       class (CLASSMASK) may be enabled. The enabling attribute is coded in
                       a bit map representation (0 if the associated mask is not allowed, 1 if it is
                       allowed). The bit mask is defined in Table 9.7.6-1. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                       (mandatory) (8 bytes)
VDSL2 US0 disabling:   The US0DISABLE attribute specifies whether channel US0 is disabled
                       for each limit PSD mask enabled in the LIMITMASK attribute.
                       For each limit PSD mask enabled in the LIMITMASK attribute, one bit
                       indicates if US0 is disabled. The disabling attribute is a bit map where
                       the value 1 specifies that US0 is disabled for the associated limit mask.
                       The bit map has the same structure as the LIMITMASK attribute. (R, W,
                       Set-by-create) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
VDSL2 US0 PSD masks: The US0MASK attribute contains the US0 PSD masks to be allowed by
                       the xTU-C. This attribute is only defined for Annex A of
                       [ITU-T G.993.2]. It is represented as a bit map (0 if not allowed, 1 if
                       allowed) with the definitions of Table 9.7.6-2. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                       (mandatory) (4 bytes)
VDSL2-CARMASK          This attribute specifies restrictions, additional to the band plan, that
table:                 determine the set of subcarriers allowed for transmission in both
                       upstream and downstream directions.
               The VDSL2-CARMASK attribute describes the not-masked subcarriers
               in terms of one or more frequency bands. Each band is represented by
               start and stop subcarrier indices with a subcarrier spacing of 4.3125 kHz.
               The valid range of subcarrier indices is from 0 to at least the index of the
               highest allowed subcarrier in both transmission directions among all
               profiles enabled by the VDSL2 profiles enabling (PROFILES) attribute.
               Up to 32 bands may be specified. Other subcarriers are masked.
               For profiles using 8.625 kHz tone spacing, the odd subcarrier indices
               i4.3125 in VDSL2-CARMASK can be transformed into actual subcarrier
               indices i8.625 using the following rule:
               –         For the start frequency of each band: i8.625 = (i4.3125 + 1)/2.
               –         For the stop frequency of each band: i8.625 = (i4.3125 – 1)/2.
               The VDSL2-CARMASK attribute is a table where each entry comprises:
               –         An entry number field (1 byte, first entry numbered 1).
               –         Band start subcarrier index (2 bytes).
               –         Band stop subcarrier index (2 bytes).
               By default, the table is empty. Entries are added or modified using the set
               action, which permits from one to as many as six breakpoints to be
               addressed in a single set message (Note 2). Setting a table entry with
               non-zero subcarrier references implies insertion into the table. Setting an
               entry's subcarrier references to zero implies deletion from the table, if
               present.
               NOTE 2 – OMCI does not provide robust exception handling when more than
               one entry is included in a set command, and multiple values per set operation
               are not recommended.
               The maximum number of breakpoints is 32, so the maximum size of the
               table is 160 bytes. (R, W) (mandatory) (5N bytes, where N is the number
               of bands)
CARMASK valid: This attribute controls and reports the status of the VDSL2-CARMASK
               table. If CARMASK valid = 1, then the VDSL2-CARMASK has been
               effectuated on the xDSL equipment. If CARMASK valid = 0 (default),
               then the VDSL2-CARMASK table is under construction and has not
               been effectuated on the xDSL equipment.
               This attribute behaves as follows:
               •         If the OLT changes any of the VDSL2-CARMASK table entries
                         or sets CARMASK valid = 0, then CARMASK valid = 0.
               •         If CARMASK valid = 0 and the OLT sets CARMASK valid = 1,
                         then the ONT updates the xDSL equipment with the content of
                         the table.
               (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
UPBOSHAPED:              Upstream power back-off (UPBO) is specified in [ITU-T G.993.2] to
                         provide spectral compatibility between loops of different lengths
                         deployed in the same cable binder. The upstream transmit PSD mask,
                         UPBOMASKus is defined in clause 7.2.1.3.2 of [ITU-T G.993.2] using
                         the formula:
                         UPBOMASK (kl0 , f ) = UPBOPSD( f ) + LOSS (kl0 , f ) + 3.5 [dBm/Hz]
                          LOSS (kl0 , f ) = kl0 f    [dB]
                         where UPBOPSD(f) = –a-b√f.
                         The UPBO configuration attributes a and b are set by the OLT via this
                         attribute. The value of kl0 may be determined during initialization by the
                         VTUs or also set by the OLT. Further detail appears in [ITU-T G.997.1].
                         This attribute includes two parameters for each band. The parameters are
                         a and b, in that order. Parameter a lies in the range 4000 (40.00 dBm/Hz)
                         to 8095 (80.95 dBm/Hz). Parameter b lies in the range 0 (0.00 dBm/Hz)
                         to 4095 (40.95 dBm/Hz). The special values a = b = 0 disable UPBO in
                         the respective upstream band.
                         The upstream electrical length parameter UPBOKL defines the electrical
                         length expressed in dB at 1 MHz, kl0, which may also be configured by
                         the OLT. Its value ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 1280 (128.0 dB).
                         If the force electrical length parameter UPBOKLF is 1, the VTU-R is
                         forced to use the electrical length from this attribute (UPBOKL) to
                         compute UPBO. Otherwise, the VTUs determine the electrical length
                         themselves.

Cyclic extension:        The CEFLAG attribute enables (1) the optional cyclic extension values.
                         If set to 0, the cyclic extension is forced to the mandatory length 5N/32.
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Downstream SNR mode:The SNRMODEds attribute controls transmitter referred virtual noise in
                         the downstream direction. If set to 1, virtual noise is disabled. If set to 2,
                         virtual noise is enabled. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Upstream SNR mode:     The SNRMODEus attribute controls transmitter referred virtual noise in
                       the upstream direction. If set to 1, virtual noise is disabled. If set to 2,
                       virtual noise is enabled. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Transmitter referred   The TXREFVNds table defines the downstream transmitter referred

downstream table:      Each breakpoint comprises a subcarrier index t, with a subcarrier spacing
                       of 4.3125 kHz, and a noise PSD level at that subcarrier. The set of
                       breakpoints can then be represented as [(t1, PSD1), (t2, PSD2), … ,
                       (tN, PSDN)]. The subcarrier index t is an unsigned two-byte integer. The
                       noise level is one byte whose value ranges from 0 (–40 dBm/Hz) to 200
                       (–140 dBm/Hz), in steps of 0.5 dB. Values between 201 and 254 indicate
                       a noise PSD level of 0 W/Hz. The maximum number of breakpoints
                       is 32.
                       Table entries for this attribute have default value 254 for the noise PSD
                       level. Entries are added or modified using the set action. Setting an entry
                       to a noise PSD level less than or equal to 254 implies insertion into the
                       table. Setting an entry's noise PSD level to 255 implies deletion from the
                       table, if present.
                       NOTE 3 – OMCI does not provide robust exception handling when more than

                       is 16.
                       Table entries for this attribute have default value 254 for the noise PSD

                                   (255.5 dB) in steps of 0.5 dB. The value 0 has the special meaning that it

9.7.7    xDSL channel configuration profile
This managed entity contains the channel configuration profile for an xDSL line. An instance of this
managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
NOTE – If [ITU-T G.997.1] compatibility is required, bit rates should only be set to integer multiples of
1000 bit/s. The ONT may reject attempts to set other values for bit rate attributes.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Minimum data rate:        This parameter specifies the minimum desired net data rate for the
                          bearer channel. It is coded in bit/s. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                          (4 bytes)
Maximum data rate:        This parameter specifies the maximum desired net data rate for the
                          bearer channel. It is coded in bit/s. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                          (4 bytes)
Rate adaptation ratio:    This attribute specifies the weight that should be taken into account
                          when performing rate adaptation in the direction of the bearer channel.
                          The attribute is defined as a percentage in the 0 to 100 range. The
                          value 20, for example, means that 20% of the available data rate (in
                          excess of the minimum data rate summed over all bearer channels) is
                          assigned to this bearer channel and 80% to the other bearer channels.
                          The OLT must assure that the sum of rate adaptation ratios over all
                          bearers in one direction is 100%. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1
                          byte)
Maximum interleaving      This attribute is the maximum one-way interleaving delay introduced by
delay:                    the PMS-TC between the alpha and the beta reference points, in the
                          direction of the bearer channel. The one-way interleaving delay is
                          defined in individual xDSL Recommendations as cap(S*D)/4 ms, where
                          S is the S factor, D is the interleaving depth, and cap() denotes rounding
                          to the next higher integer. xTUs choose S and D values such that the
                          actual one-way interleaving delay does not exceed the configured
                          maximum interleaving delay.
                          The delay is coded in ms, varying from 2 to 63, with special meaning
                          assigned to values 0, 1 and 255. The value 0 indicates no delay bound is
                          imposed. The value 1 indicates the fast latency path is to be used in the
                          G.992.1 operating mode, and S and D are to be selected such that S ≤ 1
                          and D = 1 in G.992.2, G.992.3, G.992.4, G.992.5 and G.993.2 operating
                          modes. The value 255 indicates a delay bound of 1 ms in G.993.2
                          operation. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Data rate threshold       This attribute is a threshold on the cumulative data rate upshift achieved
upshift:                  over one or more bearer channel data rate adaptations. An upshift rate
                          change (DRT up) notification is issued by the PPTP xDSL UNI part 1
                          when the actual data rate exceeds the data rate at the last entry into
                          showtime by more than the threshold. The data rate threshold is coded
                          in bit/s. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory for xDSL standards that use
                          this attribute) (4 bytes)
Data rate threshold       This attribute is a threshold on the cumulative data rate downshift
downshift:                achieved over one or more bearer channel data rate adaptations. A
                          downshift rate change (DRT down) notification is issued by the PPTP
                          xDSL UNI part 1 when the actual data rate is below the data rate at the
                          last entry into showtime by more than the threshold. The data rate
                          threshold is coded in bit/s. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory for xDSL
                          standards that use this attribute) (4 bytes)
Minimum reserved       This attribute specifies the desired minimum reserved net data rate for
data rate:             the bearer channel. The rate is coded in bit/s. This attribute is needed
                       only if the rate adaptation mode is set to dynamic in the xDSL line
                       configuration profile part 1. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (4 bytes)
Minimum data rate in   This parameter specifies the minimum desired net data rate for the
low power state:       bearer channel during the low power state (L1/L2). The power
                       management low power states L1 and L2 are defined in
                       [b-ITU-T G.992.2] and [ITU-T G.992.3], respectively. The data rate is
                       coded in bit/s. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 byte)
Minimum impulse noise The INPmin attribute specifies the minimum impulse noise protection for
protection:            the bearer channel if it is transported over DMT symbols with a
                       subcarrier spacing of 4.3125 kHz. Impulse noise protection is expressed
                       in DMT symbols with a subcarrier spacing of 4.3125 kHz. It can be 1/2
                       symbol or any integer number of symbols from 0 to 16, inclusive.
                       If the xTU does not support the configured INPmin value, it uses the
                       nearest supported impulse noise protection value greater than INPmin.

                       attribute) (1 byte)
Maximum bit error      This attribute specifies the desired maximum bit error ratio for the bearer
ratio:                 channel. It is only valid for [ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.4] and
                       [ITU-T G.992.5]. The bit error ratio is specified via the following
                       values:
                       1    10–3

protection 8 kHz:      the bearer channel if it is transported over DMT symbols with a
                       subcarrier spacing of 8.625 kHz. It is only valid for [ITU-T G.993.2].
                       Impulse noise protection is expressed in DMT symbols with a subcarrier
                       spacing of 8.625 kHz. It can take any integer value from 0 (default) to

9.7.8   xDSL subcarrier masking downstream profile
This managed entity contains the subcarrier masking downstream profile for an xDSL line.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                           The four following attributes are bit maps that represent downstream
                           mask values for subcarriers 1..128 (mask 1) through 385..512 (mask 4).
                           The MSB of the first byte corresponds to the lowest numbered
                           subcarrier, and the LSB of the last byte corresponds to the highest. Each
                           bit position defines whether the corresponding downstream subcarrier is
                           masked (1) or not masked (default value 0).
                           NSCds is the highest numbered subcarrier that can be transmitted in the
                           downstream direction. For [ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.4], and
                           [ITU-T G.992.5], it is defined in the corresponding Recommendation.
                           For [ITU-T G.992.1], NSCds = 256 and for [b-ITU-T G.992.2],
                           NSCds = 128.

mask 1:
Downstream subcarrier Subcarriers 129 to 256. (R, W) (mandatory for modems that support
mask 2:                    NSCds > 128) (16 bytes)
Downstream subcarrier Subcarriers 257 to 384. (R, W) (mandatory for modems that support
mask 3:                    NSCds > 256) (16 bytes)

mask 4:                    NSCds > 384) (16 bytes)
Mask valid:                This Boolean attribute controls and reports the operational status of the
                           downstream subcarrier mask attributes.
                           If this attribute is true (1), the downstream subcarrier mask represented
                           in this ME has been impressed on the DSL equipment.
                           If this attribute is false (0), the downstream subcarrier mask represented
                           in this ME has not been impressed on the DSL equipment. The default
                           value is false.
                           The value of this attribute can be modified by the ONT and OLT, as
                           follows:
                           •         If the OLT changes any of the four mask attributes or sets mask
                                     valid false, then mask valid is false.
                             •       If mask valid is false and the OLT sets mask valid true, the ONT
                                     impresses the downstream subcarrier mask data onto the DSL
                                     equipment.

9.7.9    xDSL subcarrier masking upstream profile
This managed entity contains the subcarrier masking upstream profile for an xDSL line. An
instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Upstream subcarrier        This attribute is a bit map representing upstream mask values for
mask:                      subcarriers 1 to 64. The MSB of byte 1 corresponds to subcarrier 1, and
                           the LSB of byte 8 corresponds to subcarrier 64. Each bit position defines
                           whether the corresponding downstream subcarrier is masked (1) or not
                           masked (default value 0).
                           Subcarrier number 1 is the lowest, and subcarrier number NSCus is the
                           highest subcarrier that can be transmitted in the upstream direction. For
                           [ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.4] and [ITU-T G.992.5], it is defined in
                           the corresponding Recommendation. For Annex A of [ITU-T G.992.1]
                           and [b-ITU-T G.992.2], NSCus = 32 and for Annex B of
                           [ITU-T G.992.1], NSCus = 64. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)

9.7.10 xDSL PSD mask profile
This managed entity contains a PSD mask profile for an xDSL line. An instance of this managed
entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
NOTE 1 – This managed entity was previously known as ADSL downstream PSD mask profile. The name
was changed so that the same managed entity could be used for both upstream and downstream.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
PSD mask table:          This attribute is a table that defines the PSD mask applicable at the U-C2
                         reference point (downstream) or the U-R2 reference point (upstream).
                         This mask may impose PSD restrictions in addition to the limit PSD mask
                         defined in the relevant Recommendations ([ITU-T G.992.5],
                         [ITU-T G.993.2]).
                         NOTE 2 – In [ITU-T G.997.1], this attribute is called PSDMASKds
                         (downstream) and PSDMASKus (upstream). In [ITU-T G.993.2], this attribute is
                         called MIBMASKds (downstream) and MIBMASKus (upstream). The
                         [ITU-T G.993.2] MIBMASKus does not include breakpoints to shape US0.
                         The PSD mask is specified through a set of breakpoints. Each breakpoint
                         comprises a two-byte subcarrier index t, with a subcarrier spacing of
                         4.3125 kHz, and a one-byte PSD mask level at that subcarrier. The set of
                         breakpoints can then be represented as [(t1, PSD1), (t2, PSD2), … ,
                         (tN, PSDN)]. The PSD mask level is coded as 0 (0.0 dBm/Hz) to 190
                         (–95.0 dBm/Hz), in steps of 0.5 dB.
                         The maximum number of downstream breakpoints is 32. In the upstream
                         direction, the maximum number of breakpoints is 4 for [ITU-T G.992.3]
                         and 16 for [ITU-T G.993.2]. The requirements for a valid set of
                         breakpoints are defined in the relevant Recommendations
                         ([ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.5], [ITU-T G.993.2]).
                         Each table entry in this attribute comprises:
                         •        An entry number field. (1 byte, first entry numbered 1)
                         •        A subcarrier index field, denoted t. (2 bytes)
                         •        A PSD mask level field. (1 byte)
                         By default, the PSD mask table is empty. Entries are added or modified
                         using the set action, which permits from one to as many as seven
                         breakpoints to be addressed in a single message (Note 3). Setting a
                         subcarrier entry with a valid PSD mask level implies insertion into the
                         table or replacement of an existing entry. Setting an entry's PSD mask
                         level to 0xFF implies deletion from the table.
                         NOTE 3 – OMCI does not provide robust exception handling when more than
                         one entry is included in a set command, and multiple values per set operation are
                         not recommended.
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (4N bytes where N is the number of breakpoints)
Mask valid:              This Boolean attribute controls and reports the status of the PSD mask
                         attribute.
                         As a status report, the value false (0) indicates that the PSD mask
                         represented in this ME has not been impressed on the DSL equipment.
                         The value true (1) indicates that the PSD mask represented in this ME has
                         been impressed on the DSL equipment.
                          This attribute behaves as follows:
                          •        If the OLT changes any of the PSD mask table entries or sets
                                   mask valid false, then mask valid is false.
                          •        If mask valid is false and the OLT sets mask valid true, the ONT
                                   impresses the PSD mask data on the DSL equipment.

Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Downstream RFI bands The RFIBANDS attribute is a table where each entry comprises:
table:                      •        An entry number field. (1 byte, first entry numbered 1)
                            •        Subcarrier index 1 field. (2 bytes)
                            •        Subcarrier index 2 field. (2 bytes)
                            For [ITU-T G.992.5], this configuration attribute defines the subset of
                            downstream PSD mask breakpoints, as specified in the downstream PSD
                            mask, to be used to notch an RFI band. This subset consists of couples
                            of consecutive subcarrier indices belonging to breakpoints: [ti; ti+1],
                            corresponding to the low level of the notch. Interpolation around these
                            points is defined in [ITU-T G.992.5].
                            For [ITU-T G.993.2], this attribute defines the bands where the PSD is
                            to be reduced as specified in clause 7.2.1.2 of [ITU-T G.993.2]. Each
                            band is represented by start and stop subcarrier indices with a subcarrier
                            spacing of 4.3125 kHz. Up to 16 bands may be specified. This attribute
                            defines the RFI bands for both upstream and downstream directions.
                            Entries have default value 0 for both subcarrier index 1 and subcarrier
                            index 2. Table entries for this attribute are added or modified using the
                            set action. Setting an entry with a non-zero subcarrier index 1 and
                            subcarrier index 2 implies insertion into the table or replacement of an
                            existing entry. Setting an entry's subcarrier index 1 and subcarrier
                            index 2 to 0 implies deletion from the table, if present.

Bands valid:                This Boolean attribute controls and reports the operational status of the
                            downstream RFI bands table.
                            If this attribute is true (1), the downstream RFI bands table has been
                            impressed on the DSL equipment.
                            If this attribute is false (0), the downstream RFI bands table has not been
                            impressed on the DSL equipment. The default value is false.
                            This attribute can be modified by the ONT and OLT, as follows:
                            •         If the OLT changes any of the RFI bands table entries or sets
                                      bands valid false, then bands valid is false.
                            •         If bands valid is false and OLT sets bands valid true, the ONT
                                      impresses the downstream RFI bands data onto the DSL
                                      equipment.

                                        This error occurs, e.g., due to corrupted messages, bad syntax
                                        messages, if no common mode can be selected in the G.994.1
                                        handshake procedure, or due to a timeout.
                                   4 No peer xTU detected
                                        This error occurs if the peer xTU is not powered or not connected
                                        or if the line is too long to allow detection of a peer xTU.

 NOTE – For backward compatibility reasons, the eighth octet of this table is represented as a separate
 attribute in separate managed entities.
9.7.13 xDSL line inventory and status data part 2
This managed entity contains part 2 of the line inventory and status data for an xDSL line. The
ONT automatically creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity upon the creation or
deletion of a physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
NOTE 1 – [ITU-T G.997.1] specifies that bit rate attributes have granularity of 1000 bit/s. If G.997.1
compliance is required, the ONT should only report values with this granularity.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a physical path termination
point xDSL UNI part 1.
Attributes
Managed entity id:               This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                 entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                 linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                                 UNI. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
xDSL transmission system: This parameter defines the transmission system in use. It is a bit map,
                                 defined in Table 9.7.12-1. (R) (mandatory) (7 bytes)
                                 NOTE 2 – An additional byte identifying VDSL2 capabilities in use is
                                 defined in the VDSL2 line inventory and status data part 1 managed entity.
                                 (R) (mandatory) (7 bytes)
Line power management            The line has four possible power management states:
state:                           0      L0: Synchronized – This line state occurs when the line has full
                                        transmission (i.e., showtime).
                                 1      L1: Power down data transmission – This line state occurs when
                                        there is transmission on the line but the net data rate is reduced
                                        (e.g., only for OAM and higher layer connection and session
                                        control). This state applies to [b-ITU-T G.992.2] only.
                                 2      L2: Power down data transmission – This line state occurs when
                                        there is transmission on the line but the net data rate is reduced
                                        (e.g., only for OAM and higher layer connection and session
                                        control). This state applies to [ITU-T G.992.3] and
                                        [ITU-T G.992.4] only.
                                 3      L3: No power – This line state occurs when no power is
                                        transmitted on the line at all.
                                 (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Downstream line              The LATNds attribute is the measured difference in the total power
attenuation:                 transmitted by the xTU-C and the total power received by the xTU-R
                             over all subcarriers during diagnostics mode and initialization. The
                             attribute value ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 1270 (127.0 dB) dB. The

transmitted downstream:     state in the downstream direction in the last full initialization
                            performed on the line. Initialization states are defined in the

9.7.14 xDSL line inventory and status data part 3
This managed entity extends the attributes defined in the xDSL line inventory and status data
parts 1 and 2. This ME reports downstream attributes.
Relationships
This is one of the status MEs pointed to by a physical path termination point xDSL managed entity.
The ONT automatically creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity upon creation or
deletion of a physical path termination point xDSL that supports these attributes.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                                managed entity. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
TSSpsds table:                  This table contains downstream transmit spectrum shaping attributes
                                expressed as the set of breakpoints exchanged during
                                [ITU-T G.994.1]. Each breakpoint consists of a two-byte subcarrier
                                index and the associated shaping attribute. The shaping attribute is
                                one byte, an integer value in the 0 to 126 range, represented as a
                                multiple of –0.5 dB. The special value 127 indicates that the
                                subcarrier is not transmitted. (R) (mandatory) (3N bytes, where N is
                                the number of breakpoints)
HLINSCds:       This attribute is the scale factor to be applied to the downstream
                Hlin(f) values. It is coded as a 16-bit unsigned integer. This attribute
                is only available after a loop diagnostic procedure. (R) (mandatory)
                (2 bytes)
HLINpsds table: This attribute is an array of complex coefficients {a, b} that represent
                the downstream transfer function Hlin(f) in linear form. Each array
                entry represents Hlin(f ) = i*HLINGds*Δf for a particular subcarrier
                group index i, ranging from 0 to min(NSds, 511). Hlin(f) may be
                reconstructed from the array as ((HLINSCds/215)*((a(i) +
                j*b(i))/215)), where a(i) and b(i) are 2s complement integers in the
                range (–215 + 1) to (+215 – 1). The granularity of a and b depends on
                the scale factor.
                The special value a(i) = b(i) = –215 indicates that no measurement
                could be done for this subcarrier group because it is out of the
                passband or that the attenuation is out of range to be represented.
                This attribute is only available after a loop diagnostic procedure. (R)
                (mandatory) (4N bytes, where N is the number of subcarrier groups)
HLOGMTds:       After a loop diagnostic procedure, this attribute contains the number
                of symbols used to measure the downstream Hlog(f) values. It is a
                16-bit unsigned value that corresponds to the value specified in the
                corresponding Recommendation (e.g., the number of symbols in a
                one-second interval for [ITU-T G.992.3]). (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
HLOGpsds table: The HLOGpsds attribute contains an array of numbers m(i), where i
                is a particular subcarrier group index, ranging from 0 to min(NSds,
                511), and m lies in the range 0..1022, with a granularity of 0.1 dB.
                The downstream transfer function Hlog(f) can be reconstructed by
                the OLT management client as (6 – m(i)/10) dBm/Hz, with a range
                from +6 to approximately –96 dBm/Hz.
                The special value m = 1023 indicates that no measurement could be
                done for this subcarrier group because it is out of the passband or that
                the attenuation is out of range to be represented.

                groups)
QLNMTds:        After a loop diagnostic procedure, the quiet line noise PSD
                measurement time attribute contains the number of symbols used to
                measure the downstream QLN(f) values. It is a 16-bit unsigned value
                that corresponds to the value specified in the Recommendation (e.g.,
                the number of symbols in a one-second interval for
                [ITU-T G.992.3]). (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
QLNpsds table:  The quiet line noise PSD attribute contains an array of numbers n(i),
                where i is a subcarrier group index, ranging from 0 to min(NSds,
                511), and n lies in the range 0..254, with granularity 0.5 dB. The
                downstream quiet line noise function QLN(f ) can be reconstructed
                by the OLT management client as (–23 – n(i)/2) dBm/Hz, with a
                range from –150 to –23 dBm/Hz.
                                The special value n = 255 indicates that no measurement could be
                                done for this subcarrier group because it is out of the passband or that
                                the noise PSD is out of range to be represented.
                                (R) (mandatory) (N bytes, where N is the number of subcarrier
                                groups)

                                attribute contains the number of symbols used to measure the
                                downstream SNR(f) values. It is a 16-bit unsigned value that
                                corresponds to the value specified in the Recommendation (e.g., the
                                number of symbols in a one-second interval for [ITU-T G.992.3]).
                                (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
SNRpsds table:                  The SNRpsds attribute contains an array of numbers snr(i), where i is
                                a subcarrier group index, ranging from 0 to min(NSds, 511), and snr
                                lies in the range 0..254, with a granularity of 0.5 dB. The
                                downstream SNR function SNR(f), can be reconstructed by the OLT
                                management client as (–32 + snr(i)/2) dBm/Hz, with a range from
                                –160 to –32 dBm/Hz.
                                The special value snr = 255 indicates that no measurement could be
                                done for this subcarrier group because it is out of the passband or that
                                the noise PSD is out of range to be represented.
                                (R) (mandatory) (N bytes, where N is the number of subcarrier

9.7.15 xDSL line inventory and status data part 4
This managed entity extends the attributes defined in the xDSL line inventory and status data
parts 1, 2 and 3. This ME reports upstream attributes.
Relationships
This is one of the status data MEs pointed to by a physical path termination point xDSL managed
entity. The ONT automatically creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity upon creation or
deletion of a physical path termination point xDSL that supports these attributes.
Attributes
Managed entity id: This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                   entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                   linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                   managed entity. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
TSSpsus table:     This attribute contains the upstream transmit spectrum shaping
                   attributes, expressed as the set of breakpoints exchanged during
                   [ITU-T G.994.1]. Each breakpoint consists of a two-byte subcarrier
                   index and the associated shaping attribute. The shaping attribute is
                   one byte, a value in the range 0..126, representing a multiple of
                   –0.5 dB. The special value 127 indicates that the subcarrier is not
                   transmitted. (R) (mandatory) (3N bytes, where N is the number of
                   breakpoints)
HLINSCus:          This attribute is a 16-bit unsigned integer, the scale factor to be
                   applied to the upstream Hlin(f) values. It is only available after a
                   loop diagnostic procedure. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
HLINpsus table:    This attribute is an array of complex upstream Hlin(f) values in linear

HLOGMTus:          After a loop diagnostic procedure, this attribute contains the number
                   of symbols used to measure the upstream Hlog(f) values. Its value
                   corresponds to the value specified in the corresponding
                   Recommendation (e.g., the number of symbols in a 1-second interval
                   for [ITU-T G.992.3]). (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
HLOGpsus table:    This attribute is an array of real upstream Hlog(f) values. It is coded
                   in the same way as the related downstream attribute HLOGpsds (see

                   in a 1-second interval for [ITU-T G.992.3]). (R) (mandatory)
                   (2 bytes)
QLNpsus table:     The quiet line noise attribute represents an array of real upstream
                   QLN(f) values. It is coded in the same way as the related
                   downstream attribute QLNpsds (see xDSL line inventory and status
                   data part 3). (R) (mandatory) (N bytes, where N is the number of
                   subcarrier groups)
SNRMTus:           After a loop diagnostic procedure, the SNR measurement time
                   attribute reports the number of symbols used to measure the upstream
                   SNR(f) values. Its value corresponds to the value specified in the
                   Recommendation (e.g., the number of symbols in a 1-second interval
                   for [ITU-T G.992.3]). (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
SNRpsus table:                  This attribute is an array of real upstream SNR(f) values. It is coded
                                in the same way as the related downstream attribute SNRpsds (see
                                xDSL line inventory and status data part 3). (R) (mandatory)
                                (N bytes, where N is the number of subcarrier groups)

9.7.18 VDSL2 line inventory and status data part 3
This managed entity extends the other xDSL line inventory and status data MEs with attributes
specific to VDSL2. This ME contains per-band attributes for both directions. These same attributes
are defined in the xDSL line inventory and status data part 2 managed entity, but only for a single
band. [ITU-T G.993.2] allows for VDSL2 to have as many as five bands upstream and as many as
five bands downstream.
This is one of the status data MEs pointed to by a physical path termination point xDSL managed
entity. It is required only if VDSL2 is supported by the PPTP. The ONT automatically creates or
deletes an instance of this managed entity upon creation or deletion of a physical path termination
point xDSL that supports these attributes.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                                managed entity. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Upstream bands count:           This attribute reports the number of upstream bands. It can be used to
                                filter the upstream attributes. All upstream attributes are arrays of
                                per-band entries, of which the first upstream bands count are
                                populated. The content of the arrays for unused frequency bands is
                                unspecified. The original attributes were allocated for as many as
                                four upstream bands, US0, 1, 2, 3; optional extended attributes have
                                been added to accommodate the possibility that five upstream bands
                                may be needed. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Downstream bands count:         This attribute reports the number of downstream bands. It can be
                                used to filter the downstream attributes. All downstream attributes
                                are arrays of per-band entries, of which the first downstream bands
                                count are populated. The content of the arrays for unused frequency
                                bands is unspecified. The original attributes were allocated for as
                                many as three upstream bands, DS1, 2, 3; optional extended
                                attributes have been added to accommodate the possibility that five
                                downstream bands may be needed. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Downstream line                 The LATNds attribute is defined per usable band. It is the measured
attenuation per band:           difference in the total power transmitted in this band by the xTU-C
                                and the total power received in this band by the xTU-R over all
                                subcarriers of this band during loop diagnostic mode and
                                initialization. The upstream line attenuation per band ranges from 0
                                (0.0 dB) to 1270 (+127.0 dB). The special value 0xFFFF indicates
                                the line attenuation per band is out of range to be represented. (R)
                                (mandatory) (3 bands * 2 bytes = 6 bytes)
Upstream line attenuation       The LATNus attribute is defined per usable band. It is the measured
per band:                       difference in the total power transmitted in this band by the xTU-R
                                and the total power received in this band by the xTU-C over all
                                subcarriers of this band during loop diagnostic mode and
                                initialization. The upstream line attenuation per band ranges from 0
                                (0.0 dB) to 1270 (+127.0 dB). The special value 0xFFFF indicates
                                that line attenuation per band is out of range to be represented. (R)
                                (mandatory) (4 bands * 2 bytes = 8 bytes)
Downstream signal               The SATNds attribute is defined per usable band. It is the measured
attenuation per band:           difference in the total power transmitted in this band by the xTU-C
                                and the total power received in this band by the xTU-R over all
                                subcarriers of this band during showtime. The downstream signal
                                attenuation per band ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 1270 (+127.0 dB).
                                The special value 0xFFFF indicates that signal attenuation per band
                                is out of range to be represented.
                            transmitted by the xTU-C, as compared to loop diagnostic mode and
                            initialization. Therefore, the downstream signal attenuation may be
                            significantly lower than the downstream line attenuation.
                            (R) (mandatory) (3 bands * 2 bytes = 6 bytes)
Upstream signal attenuation The SATNus attribute is defined per usable band. It is the measured
per band:                   difference in the total power transmitted in this band by the xTU-R
                            and the total power received in this band by the xTU-C over all
                            subcarriers of this band during showtime. The upstream signal
                            attenuation per band ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 1270 (+127.0 dB).
                            The special value 0xFFFF indicates the signal attenuation per band is
                            out of range to be represented.
                            NOTE 2 – During showtime, only a subset of the subcarriers may be
                            transmitted by the xTU-R, as compared to loop diagnostic mode and
                            initialization. Therefore, the upstream signal attenuation may be
                            significantly lower than the upstream line attenuation.
                            (R) (mandatory) (4 bands * 2 bytes = 8 bytes)
Downstream signal-to-noise The SNRMpbds attribute is defined per usable band. The
ratio margin per band:      downstream signal to noise ratio margin per band is the maximum
                            increase of noise power received at the xTU-R, such that the BER
                            requirements are met for all downstream bearer channels. Each array
                            value ranges from 0 (–64.0 dB) to 1270 (+63.0 dB). The special
                            value 0xFFFF indicates that the attribute is out of range to be
                            represented. (R) (mandatory) (3 bands * 2 bytes = 6 bytes)
Upstream signal-to-noise    The SNRMpbus attribute is defined per usable band. The upstream
ratio margin per band:      signal to noise ratio margin per band is the maximum increase of
                            noise power received at the xTU-C, such that the BER requirements
                            are met for all upstream bearer channels. Each array value ranges
                            from 0 (–64.0 dB) to 1270 (+63.0 dB). The special value 0xFFFF
                            indicates that the attribute is out of range to be represented. (R)
                            (mandatory) (4 bands * 2 bytes = 8 bytes)
Downstream line             This attribute extends LATNds when more than three downstream
attenuation extension:      bands are used. It is defined in the same way as the downstream line
                            attenuation per band attribute. (R) (optional) (2 bands * 2 bytes =

9.7.19 xDSL channel downstream status data
This managed entity contains the xDSL channel downstream status data for an xDSL line. The ONT
automatically creates or deletes instances of this managed entity upon the creation or deletion of a
physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
NOTE – [ITU-T G.997.1] specifies that bit rate attributes have granularity of 1000 bit/s. If [ITU-T G.997.1]
compliance is required, the ONT should only report values with this granularity.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a physical path
termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                entity. The two most significant bits of the first byte are the bearer
                                channel ID. Excluding the first two bits of the first byte, the
                                remaining part of the managed entity ID is identical to that of this
                                ME's parent physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 1. (R)
                                (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Actual interleaving delay:      This attribute is the actual one-way interleaving delay introduced by
                                the PMS-TC between the alpha and beta reference points, excluding
                                delay in L1 and L2 state. In L1 and L2 state, the attribute contains
                                the interleaving delay in the previous L0 state. For ADSL, this
                                attribute is derived from the S and D attributes as cap(S*D)/4 ms,
                                where S is the number of symbols per codeword, D is the
                                interleaving depth and cap() denotes rounding to the next higher
                                integer. For [ITU-T G.993.2], this attribute is computed according to
                                the formula in clause 9.7 of [ITU-T G.993.2]. The actual interleaving
                                delay is coded in ms, rounded to the nearest ms. (R) (mandatory)
                                (1 byte)
Actual data rate:               This parameter reports the actual net data rate the bearer channel is
                                operating at, excluding the rate in L1 and L2 states. In L1 or L2
                                states, the parameter contains the net data rate in the previous L0
                                state. The data rate is coded in bit/s. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Previous data rate:         This parameter reports the previous net data rate the bearer channel
                            was operating at just before the latest rate change event occurred,
                            excluding transitions between the L0 state and the L1 or L2 states. A
                            rate change can occur at a power management state transition, e.g., at
                            full or short initialization, fast retrain, or power down, or at a
                            dynamic rate adaptation. The rate is coded in bit/s (R) (mandatory)
                            (4 bytes)
Actual impulse noise        The ACTINP attribute reports the actual impulse noise protection
protection:                 (INP) on the bearer channel in the L0 state. In the L1 or L2 state, the
                            attribute contains the INP in the previous L0 state.
                            For ADSL, this value is computed according to the formula specified
                            in the relevant Recommendation based on the actual framing
                            attributes. [ITU-T G.993.2] VDSL2 specifies no means to retrieve
                            the impulse noise protection estimated by the xTU-R receiver.
                            Therefore, the far-end ACTINP is computed according to the
                            INP_no_erasure formula.
                            The value of this attribute is a number of DMT symbols, with a
                            granularity of 0.1 symbols. Its range is from 0 (0.0 symbols) to 254
                            (25.4 symbols). The special value 255 indicates an ACTINP higher
                            than 25.4.
                            (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Actual size of Reed-Solomon The NFEC attribute reports the actual Reed-Solomon codeword size
codeword:                   used in the latency path in which the bearer channel is transported.
                            The value is coded in bytes and ranges from 0..255. (R) (mandatory
                            for [ITU-T G.993.2] VDSL2, optional for others) (1 byte)
Actual number of            The RFEC attribute reports the actual number of Reed-Solomon
Reed-Solomon redundancy redundancy bytes per codeword used in the latency path in which the
bytes:                      bearer channel is transported. The value is coded in bytes and ranges
                            from 0..16. The value 0 indicates no Reed-Solomon coding. (R)
                            (mandatory for [ITU-T G.993.2] VDSL2, optional for others)
                            (1 byte)
Actual number of bits per   The LSYMB attribute reports the actual number of bits per symbol
symbol:                     assigned to the latency path in which the bearer channel is
                            transported, excluding trellis overhead. The value is coded in bits and
                            ranges from 0..65535. (R) (mandatory for [ITU-T G.993.2] VDSL2,
                            optional for others) (2 bytes)
Actual interleaving depth:  The INTLVDEPTH attribute reports the actual depth of the
                            interleaver used in the latency path in which the bearer channel is
                            transported. The value ranges from 1..4096 in steps of 1. The value 1
                            indicates no interleaving. (R) (mandatory for [ITU-T G.993.2]
                            VDSL2, optional for others) (2 bytes)
Actual interleaving block   The INTLVBLOCK attribute reports the actual block length of the
length:                     interleaver used in the latency path in which the bearer channel is
                            transported. The value ranges from 4..255 in steps of 1. (R)
                            (mandatory for [ITU-T G.993.2] VDSL2, optional for others)

                               which the bearer channel is transported. Valid values are 0..3. In
                               [ITU-T G.992.1], the fast path is mapped to latency index 0; the
                               interleaved path to index 1. (R) (mandatory for [ITU-T G.993.2]

                               the L1 and L2 states. In L1 and L2 state, this attribute contains the
                               interleaving delay in the previous L0 state. For ADSL, this attribute
                               is derived from the S and D attributes as cap(S*D)/4 ms, where S is
                               the number of symbols per codeword, D is the interleaving depth and
                               cap() denotes rounding to the next higher integer. For
                               [ITU-T G.993.2], this attribute is computed according to the formula
                               in clause 9.7 of [ITU-T G.993.2]. The actual interleaving delay is

                            Recommendation based on the actual framing attributes. For
                            [ITU-T G.993.2], the method to report this value is according to the
                            INPREPORT attribute. The value is coded in fractions of DMT
                            symbols with a granularity of 0.1 symbols. The range is from 0
                            (0.0 symbols) to 254 (25.4 symbols). The special value 255 indicates
                            an ACTINP higher than 25.4. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Impulse noise protection    The INPREPORT attribute reports the method used to compute the
reporting mode:             ACTINP. If set to 0, the ACTINP is computed according to the
                            INP_no_erasure formula (clause 9.6 of [ITU-T G.993.2]). If set to 1,
                            the ACTINP is the value estimated by the xTU receiver. (R)

9.7.21 xDSL xTU-C performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data on the xTU-C to xTU-R path as seen
from the xTU-C. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a physical path termination
point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                               entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                               linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                               UNI. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:             This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.

Loss of power seconds:         (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Errored seconds:               This attribute counts one-second intervals with one or more CRC-8
                               anomalies summed over all received bearer channels, or one or more
                               LOS defects, or one or more SEF defects, or one or more LPR
                               defects. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Severely errored seconds:      This attribute counts severely errored seconds (SES-L). An SES is
                               declared if, during a one-second interval, there were 18 or more
                               CRC-8 anomalies in one or more of the received bearer channels, or
                               one or more LOS defects, or one or more SEF defects, or one or
                               more LPR defects.
                               If the relevant Recommendation ([ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.5],
                               [ITU-T G.993.2]) supports a one-second normalized CRC-8 anomaly
                               counter increment, the one-second SES counter follows this value
                               instead of counting CRC-8 anomalies directly.
                               If a common CRC is applied over multiple bearer channels, then each
                               related CRC-8 anomaly is counted only once for the whole set of
                               bearer channels over which the CRC is applied.

                                  procedure. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Short initializations:            This attribute counts the total number of fast retrains or short
                                  initializations attempted on the line, successful and failed. Fast
                                  retrain is defined in [b-ITU-T G.992.2]. Short initialization is defined
                                  in [ITU-T G.992.3] and [ITU-T G.992.4]. (R) (optional) (2 bytes)
Failed short initializations: This attribute counts the total number of failed fast retrains or short
                                  initializations during the accumulation period, e.g., when:
                                  – A CRC error is detected.
                                  – A timeout occurs.
                                  – A fast retrain profile is unknown.

                                  correction anomaly. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Unavailable seconds:              This attribute counts one-second intervals during which the xDSL
                                  line is unavailable. The line becomes unavailable at the onset of
                                  10 contiguous SES-Ls. The 10 SES-Ls are included in unavailable
                                  time. Once unavailable, the line becomes available at the onset of
                                  10 contiguous seconds that are not severely errored. The 10 seconds
                                  with no SES-Ls are excluded from unavailable time. Some attribute
                                  counts are inhibited during unavailability – see clause 7.2.7.13 of
                                  [ITU-T G.997.1]. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)

9.8.1     Physical path termination point CES UNI
This managed entity represents the point at a CES UNI in the ONT where the physical path
terminates and physical level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•         When the ONT has CES ports built into its factory configuration.
•         When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of CES type.
•         When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of CES
          type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of CES
          ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
          port mapping package that specifies CES ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a CES circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a CES circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each real or preprovisioned CES port. It can
be linked from a pseudowire TP, a logical N x 64 kbit/s CTP, or an interworking TP.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the
                              UNI. The first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second
                              byte is the port ID, with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Expected type:                The following coding is used for this attribute:
                              0           Autosense.
                              1 to 254    One of the values from Table 9.1.5-1 that is compatible
                                          with a CES circuit pack.
                              Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                              (mandatory) (1 byte)
Sensed type:                  If the value of expected type is not 0, then the value of sensed type
                              equals the value of expected type. If expected type = 0, then the
                              value of sensed type is one of the compatible values from
                              Table 9.1.5-1. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0
                              or to the value that reflects the physically present equipment. (R)
                              (mandatory if the ONT supports circuit packs with configurable

9.8.2    Logical N x 64 kbit/s sub-port connection termination point
This managed entity models logical sub-ports contained within a higher level TDM physical layer
interface (e.g., DS0s within a DS1, DS1s within a DS3, etc.). An instance of this managed entity
can represent an arbitrary (i.e., consecutive or non-consecutive) group of multiple channels/time
slots (e.g., multiple DS0/DS1) as an integral bundle.
An instance of this managed entity is created by the OLT before the creation of an associated
interworking termination point (see clause 9.2.4, GEM interworking termination point).
Relationships
Zero or more instances of this ME are associated with an instance of the physical path termination
point CES UNI. It can be linked from a pseudowire TP, a logical N x 64 kbit/s CTP, or an
interworking TP.

Near-end IP info:     When the pseudowire service is transported via IP, this attribute
                      points to an instance of the TCP/UDP config data managed entity.
                      The default value 0 is applicable if the pseudowire is not transported
                      via IP. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory for IP transport) (2 bytes)
Far-end IP info:      When the pseudowire service is transported via IP, this attribute
                      points to a large string managed entity that contains the URI of the
                      far-end termination point, for example:
                         udp://192.168.100.221:5000 or
                         udp://pwe3srvr.int.example.net:2222
                      The default value 0 is applicable if the pseudowire is not transported

Payload size:         Number of payload bytes per packet. Valid only if service type =
                      unstructured or unstructured octet-aligned. Valid choices depend on
                      the TDM service, but must include the following. Other choices are
                      at the vendor's discretion.

                             (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Transmit circuit ID:         This attribute is a pair of ECID (Ethernet circuit ID) values that the
                             ONT transmits in the direction from the TDM termination toward the
                             packet-switched network. MEF8 ECIDs lie in the range 1..1048575
                             (220 – 1). To allow for the possibility of other transport (L2TP) in the
                             future, each ECID is allocated 4 bytes.
                             The first value is used for the payload ECID; the second is used for
                             the optional separate signalling ECID. The first ECID is required for
                             all MEF8 pseudowires; the second is required only if signalling is to
                             be carried in a distinct channel. If signalling is not present, or is
                             carried in the same channel as the payload, the second ECID should
                             be set to 0.
                             (R, W) (mandatory for MEF8 transport) (8 bytes)
Expected circuit ID:         This attribute is a pair of ECID (Ethernet circuit ID) values that the
                             ONT can expect in the direction from the packet-switched network
                             toward the TDM termination. Checking ECIDs may be a way to
                             detect circuit misconnection. MEF8 ECIDs lie in the range
                             1..1048575 (220 – 1). To allow for the possibility of other transport
                             (L2TP) in the future, each ECID is allocated 4 bytes.
                             The first value is used for the payload ECID; the second is used for
                             the optional separate signalling ECID. In both cases, the default value
                             0 indicates that no ECID checking is expected.
                             (R, W) (optional for MEF8 transport) (8 bytes)
Received circuit ID:         This attribute indicates the actual ECID(s) received on the payload
                             and signalling channels, respectively. It may be used for diagnostic
                             purposes. (R) (optional for MEF8 transport) (8 bytes)
Exception policy:            This attribute points to an instance of the pseudowire maintenance
                             profile managed entity. If the pointer has its default value 0, the
                             ONT's internal defaults apply. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)

9.8.6     RTP pseudowire parameters
If a pseudowire service uses RTP, the RTP pseudowire parameters managed entity provides
configuration information for the RTP layer. Instances of this managed entity are created and
deleted by the OLT. The use of RTP on a pseudowire is optional, and is determined by the existence
of the RTP pseudowire parameters managed entity.
Relationships
An instance of the RTP pseudowire parameters managed entity may exist for each pseudowire
termination point managed entity, to which it is implicitly bound by a common managed entity ID.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                               entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                               linked to an instance of the pseudowire termination point managed
                               entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Clock reference:               This attribute specifies the frequency of the common timing
                               reference, in multiples of 8 kHz. The default value is 1 (8 kHz).
                               (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                                generated in the TDM to PSN direction.
                                0    Unknown or not applicable (default).
                                1    Absolute. Timestamps are based on the timing of the incoming
                                     TDM signal.
                                2    Differential. Timestamps are based on the ONT's reference
                                     clock, which is understood to be stratum-traceable along with
                                     the reference clock at the far end.
                                (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
PTYPE:                          This attribute specifies the RTP payload type in the TDM to PSN
                                direction. It comprises two values. The first is for the payload
                                channel, the second, for the optional separate signalling channel.
                                Assignable PTYPEs lie in the dynamic range 96..127. If signalling is
                                not transported in its own channel, the second value should be set to
                                0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
SSRC:                           This attribute specifies the RTP synchronization source in the TDM
                                to PSN direction. It comprises two values. The first is for the payload
                                channel, the second, for the optional separate signalling channel. If
                                signalling is not transported in its own channel, the second value
                                should be set to 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
Expected PTYPE:                 This attribute specifies the RTP payload type in the PSN to TDM
                                direction. The received payload type may be used to detect
                                malformed packets. It comprises two values. The first is for the
                                payload channel, the second, for the optional separate signalling
                                channel. To disable either or both of the check functions, set the
                                corresponding value to its default value 0. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                                (optional) (2 bytes)
Expected SSRC:                  This attribute specifies the RTP synchronization source in the PSN to
                                TDM direction. The received SSRC may be used to detect
                                misconnection (stray packets). It comprises two values. The first is
                                for the payload channel, the second, for the optional separate
                                signalling channel. To disable either or both of the check functions,
                                set the corresponding value to its default value 0. (R, W,

9.8.7   Pseudowire maintenance profile
The pseudowire maintenance profile permits the configuration of pseudowire service exception
handling. It is created and deleted by the OLT.
The settings, and indeed existence, of a pseudowire maintenance profile affect the behaviour of the
pseudowire performance monitoring history data managed entity only in establishing criteria for
counting severely errored seconds, but in no other way. The pseudowire maintenance profile
primarily affects the alarms declared by the subscribing pseudowire termination point.
One or more instances of the pseudowire termination point may point to an instance of the
pseudowire maintenance profile. If the pseudowire termination point does not refer to a pseudowire
maintenance profile, the ONT's default exception handling is implied.
Attributes
Managed entity id:               This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                 entity. The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                                 (2 bytes)
Jitter buffer maximum            This attribute specifies the desired maximum depth of the playout
depth:                           buffer in the PSN to TDM direction. The value is expressed as a
                                 multiple of the 125 μs frame rate. The default value 0 selects the
                                 ONT's internal policy. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (2 bytes)
Jitter buffer desired depth: This attribute specifies the desired nominal fill depth of the playout
                                 buffer in the PSN to TDM direction. The value is expressed as a
                                 multiple of the 125 μs frame rate. The default value 0 selects the
                                 ONT's internal policy. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (2 bytes)
Fill policy:                     This attribute defines the payload bit pattern to be applied toward the
                                 TDM service if no payload packet is available to play out. The
                                 default value 0 specifies that the ONT apply its internal policy.

Four pairs of alarm-related policy attributes, defined below, share common behaviour.
The alarm declaration policy attribute defines the anomaly rate that causes the corresponding alarm
to be declared. It is an integer percentage between 1..100. If this density of anomalies occurs during
the alarm onset soak interval, the alarm is declared. The default value 0 selects the ONT's internal
policy.
The alarm clear policy attribute defines the anomaly rate that causes the corresponding alarm to be
cleared. It is an integer percentage between 0..99. If no more than this density of anomalies occurs
during the alarm clear soak interval, the alarm is cleared. The default value 255 selects the ONT's
internal policy.

                              indicating lost packets to the far end. The default value 0 selects the
                              ONT's internal policy. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
R-bit transmit clear policy: This attribute defines the number of consecutive valid packets that
                              causes the transmitted R-bit to be cleared in the TDM to PSN
                              direction, removing the remote failure indication to the far end. The
                              default value 0 selects the ONT's internal policy. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)

This managed entity collects PM for a pseudowire termination point. Most of the attributes monitor
packets received from the PSN, and may therefore be considered egress PM. For the most part,
ingress PM is collected at the CES PPTP managed entity.
NOTE – The pseudowire performance monitoring history data managed entity collects data similar, but not
identical, to that available from the MAC bridge port PM history data ME associated with a MAC bridge.
When the pseudowire is bridge-based, it may not be necessary to collect both.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the pseudowire termination
point.

                                  Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Received packets:                 This attribute counts the total number of packets, both payload and
                                  signalling, received in the PSN to TDM direction. (R) (mandatory)
                                  (4 bytes)
Transmitted packets:              This attribute counts the total number of packets, both payload and
                                  signalling, transmitted from the TDM to the PSN. The count includes
                                  packets whose L-bit is set and which may therefore contain no
                                  payload. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Missing packets:                  This attribute counts the number of lost packets, as indicated by gaps
                                  in the control word numbering sequence. Both payload and signalling
                                  packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Misordered packets, usable: This attribute counts the number of packets received out of order, but
                                  which were able to be successfully re-ordered and played out. Both
                                  payload and signalling packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Misordered packets                This attribute counts the number of packets received out of sequence
dropped:                          that were discarded, either because the ONT did not support
                                  reordering or because it was too late to reorder them. Both payload
                                  and signalling packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Playout buffer                    This attribute counts the number of packets that were discarded
underruns/overruns:               because they arrived too late or too early to be played out. Both
                                  payload and signalling packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Malformed packets:             This attribute counts the number of malformed packets, for example
                               because the packet length was not as expected or because of
                               unexpected RTP payload type. Both payload and signalling packets,
                               if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Stray packets:                 This attribute counts the number of packets whose ECID or RTP
                               SSRC failed to match the expected value, or which are otherwise
                               known to have been misdelivered. Stray packets are discarded
                               without affecting any of the other PM counters. Both payload and
                               signalling packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory)
                               (4 bytes)
Remote packet loss:            This attribute counts received packets whose R-bit is set, indicating
                               the loss of packets at the far end. Both payload and signalling
                               packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
TDM L-bit packets              This attribute counts the number of packets transmitted with the L-bit
transmitted:                   set, indicating a near-end TDM fault. Both payload and signalling
                               packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
ES:                            This attribute counts errored seconds. Any discarded, lost, malformed
                               or unusable packet received from the PSN during a given second
                               causes this counter to increment. Both payload and signalling
                               packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
SES:                           This attribute counts severely errored seconds. The criterion for a
                               SES may be configured through the pseudowire maintenance profile
                               managed entity. Both payload and signalling packets, if any,
                               contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
UAS:                           This attribute counts unavailable seconds. An unavailable second
                               begins at the onset of ten consecutive SESs and ends at the onset of
                               ten consecutive seconds that are not severely errored. A service is
                               unavailable if either its payload or its signalling, if any, are
                               unavailable. During unavailable time, only UAS should be counted;
                               other anomalies should not be counted. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)

9.8.10 TU CTP
This managed entity organizes data that describes the TU path adaptation processing functions of
the ONT for SDH services. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted at the request of
the OLT.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity may be associated with an instance of a physical path
termination point CES UNI that supports SDH.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute provides a unique number for each instance of this

GEM frame loss integration This attribute specifies the GEM frame loss integration period in
period:                       milliseconds. If GEM frame loss persists for this period, the
                              associated GEM interworking termination point generates a GEM
                              frame starvation alarm. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Transmit J1/J2:               This attribute is the path trace byte string that the ONT transmits
                              upstream. Its default value is null. If set, the ONT inserts a byte of
                              this attribute into the J1 or J2 into each TU payload frame. See
                              [ITU-T G.707] for further information. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (16 bytes)
Expected J1/J2:               This attribute is the path trace byte string that the ONT expects to
                              receive in the downstream direction. Its default value is null. If set,
                              the ONT compares the J1 or J2 in each received TU payload with this
                              attribute. If the received J1/J2 string differs, a TIM alarm is
                              generated. See [ITU-T G.707] for further information. (R, W,

9.8.11 TU performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data from SDH TUs. Most of the parameters
are received from the GEM layer, and may therefore be considered egress PM. For the most part,
ingress PM is collected at the CES managed entity.
Instances of this ME are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity may exist for each instance of the TU CTP managed entity.

9.9.1   Physical path termination point POTS UNI
This managed entity represents the point at a POTS UNI in the ONT where a physical path
terminates and physical path level functions (analogue telephony) are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•       When the ONT has POTS ports built into its factory configuration.
•       When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of POTS type.
•       When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of POTS
        type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of POTS
        ports via equipment ID as well as type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a port
        mapping package that specifies POTS ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a POTS circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a POTS circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each real or preprovisioned POTS port. SIP
and VoIP voice CTPs may link to the POTS UNI, which in turn points to a GEM interworking TP.
Status is available from a VoIP line status ME, and RTP and call control PM may be collected on
this point.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the
                              UNI. The first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). If the UNI
                              is integrated, this value is 0. The second byte is the port ID, with
                              range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Administrative state:         This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by
                              this managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all
                              user functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs
                              for this managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no
                              longer generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is
                              outside the scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory)
                              (1 byte)
Interworking TP pointer:      This attribute points to the associated instance of the GEM
                              interworking termination point managed entity. The value 0 is a null
                              pointer. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
ARC:                          See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:                 See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Impedance:                    This attribute specifies the impedance for the POTS UNI. Valid
                              values include:
                              0   600 Ohms.
                              1   900 Ohms.
                              The following parameter sets from Annex C of [ETSI TS 101 270-1]
                              are also defined:
                              2   C1=150 nF, R1=750 Ohm, R2=270 Ohm.
                              3   C1=115 nF, R1=820 Ohm, R2=220 Ohm.
                              4   C1=230 nF, R1=1050 Ohm, R2=320 Ohm.
                              Where C1, R1, and R2 are related as shown in Figure 9.9.1-1. Upon
                              ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W) (optional)

Rx gain:                      This attribute specifies a gain value for the received signal in the
                              form of a 2s complement number. Valid values are –120 (–12.0 dB)
                              to 60 (+6.0 dB). Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to
                              0. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Tx gain:                      This attribute specifies a gain value for the transmit signal in the form
                              of a 2s complement number. Valid values are –120 (–12.0 dB) to 60
                              (+6.0 dB). Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0.
                              (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Operational state:            This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable
                              of performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled
                              (1). (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Hook state:                   This attribute indicates the current state of the subscriber line: 0 = on
                              hook, 1 = off hook. (R) (Optional) (1 byte)
POTS holdover time:           This attribute determines the time during which POTS loop voltage is
                              held up when the ONT is not ranged on the PON. After the specified
                              time elapses, the ONT drops loop voltage, and may thereby cause
                              premises intrusion alarm circuits to go active. When the ONT ranges
                              successfully on the PON, it restores POTS loop voltage immediately
                              and resets the timer to zero. The attribute is expressed in seconds.
                              The default value 0 selects the vendor's factory policy. (R, W)

9.9.2    SIP user data
The SIP user data defines the user-specific configuration attributes associated with a specific VoIP
CTP. This entity is conditionally required for ONTs that offer VoIP SIP services. If a non-OMCI
interface is used to manage SIP for VoIP, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI interface supplies
the necessary data, which may be read back to the OLT via the SIP config portal ME.
An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT. A SIP user data instance is
required for each POTS UNI port using SIP protocol and configured by OMCI.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with one VoIP voice CTP managed entity and a
PPTP POTS UNI.

9.9.3    SIP agent config data
The SIP agent config data managed entity models a SIP signalling agent. It defines the
configuration necessary to establish communication for signalling between the SIP user agent and a
SIP server.
NOTE – If a non-OMCI interface is used to manage SIP for VoIP, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI
interface supplies the necessary data, which may be read back to the OLT via the SIP config portal ME.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity serves one or more SIP user data managed entities and points to
a TCP/UDP config data that carries signalling messages. Other pointers establish additional agent
parameters such as proxy servers.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                  entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Proxy server address              This attribute points to a large string ME that contains the name
pointer:                          (IP address or URI) of the SIP proxy server for SIP signalling
                                  messages. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Outbound proxy address     This attribute points to a large string ME that contains the name (IP
pointer:                   address or URI) of the outbound proxy server for SIP signalling
                           messages. An outbound SIP proxy may or may not be required within
                           a given network. If an outbound SIP proxy is used, the outbound
                           proxy address pointer attribute must be set to point to a valid large
                           string ME. If an outbound SIP proxy is not used, the outbound proxy
                           address pointer attribute must be set to a null pointer. (R, W,
                           Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Primary SIP DNS:           This attribute specifies the primary SIP DNS IP address. If this value

                           Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Secondary SIP DNS:         This attribute specifies the secondary SIP DNS IP address. If this
                           value is 0, no secondary SIP DNS is defined. The default value is 0.
                           (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
TCP/UDP pointer:           This pointer associates the SIP agent with the TCP/UDP config data
                           ME to be used for communication with the SIP server. The default
                           value is 0xFFFF. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
SIP reg exp time:          This attribute specifies the SIP registration expiration time in
                           seconds. If its value is 0, the SIP agent does not add an expiration
                           time to the registration requests and does not perform re-registration.
                           The default value is 3600 seconds. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
SIP rereg head start time: This attribute specifies the time in seconds prior to timeout that
                           causes the SIP agent to start the re-registration process. The default
                           value is 360 seconds. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Host part URI:             This attribute points to a large string ME that contains the host or
                           domain part of the SIP address of record for users connected to this
                           ONT. The default value 0xFFFF indicates that the current address in
                           the IP host config ME is used. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)

 In any event, only one ME should declare the alarm, not both.
9.9.4     VoIP voice CTP
The VoIP voice CTP defines the attributes necessary to associate a specified VoIP service (SIP
(e.g., [b-IETF RFC 3261]), [ITU-T H.248.x]) with a POTS UNI. This entity is conditionally
required for ONTs that offer VoIP services. If a non-OMCI interface is used to manage VoIP
signalling, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI interface supplies the necessary data, which may
be read back to the OLT via the SIP config portal ME or the MGC config portal ME.
An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT. A VoIP voice CTP managed
object is needed for each PPTP POTS UNI served by VoIP.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity links a PPTP POTS managed entity with a VoIP media profile
and a SIP user data or MGC config data ME.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed

9.9.18 VoIP config data
The VoIP configuration data managed entity defines the configuration for VoIP in the ONT. The
OLT uses this ME to discover the VoIP signalling protocols and configuration methods supported
by this ONT. The OLT then uses this ME to select the desired signalling protocol and configuration
method. The entity is conditionally required for ONTs that offer VoIP services.
An ONT that supports VoIP services automatically creates an instance of this managed entity.
Relationships
One instance of the managed entity is associated with the ONT.

9.9.21 Physical path termination point ISDN UNI
This managed entity represents the point at a basic rate ISDN UNI where physical paths terminate
and physical path level functions (e.g., analogue telephony, facsimile function) are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•        When the ONT has ISDN ports built into its factory configuration.
•        When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of ISDN type.
•        When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of ISDN
         type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of ISDN
         ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
         port mapping package that specifies ISDN ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an ISDN circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an ISDN circuit pack.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity are associated with the ONT-G or a circuit pack
managed entity classified as ISDN type.

9.10     MoCA
This clause defines managed entities associated with MoCA UNIs, as shown in Figure 9.10-1.
                   Figure 9.10-1 – Managed entities associated with MoCA UNIs
9.10.1 Physical path termination point MoCA UNI
This managed entity represents a MoCA UNI, where physical paths terminate and physical path
level functions (i.e., the MoCA function) are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•        When the ONT has MoCA ports built into its factory configuration.
•        When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of MoCA type.
•        When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of MoCA
         type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of MoCA
         ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
         port mapping package that specifies MoCA ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a MoCA circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a MoCA circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each real or preprovisioned MoCA port.

PPPoE filter:           This attribute controls filtering of PPPoE packets on this MoCA port.
                        When its value is 1, all packets other than PPPoE packets are discarded.
                        The default 0 accepts packets of all types. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Network status:         This attribute indicates the networking state of the MoCA interface.
                        0    The interface has not joined a MoCA network.
                        1    The interface has joined a MoCA network.
                        2    The interface has joined a MoCA network and is currently the
                             network coordinator.
                        (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Password:                    This attribute specifies the MoCA encryption key. It is an ASCII string
                             of 17 decimal digits. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute
                             to 17 null bytes. (R, W) (mandatory) (17 bytes)
Privacy enabled:             This attribute activates (1) link-layer security. The default value 0
                             deactivates it. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Minimum bandwidth            This attribute specifies the minimum desired PHY link bandwidth
alarm threshold:             between two nodes. If the actual bandwidth is lower, a limited link alarm
                             is declared. Valid values are 0 to 0x0410 (260 Mbit/s) in 0.25-Mbit/s
                             increments. The default value is 0x02D0 (180 Mbit/s). The value 0
                             disables the threshold. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
Frequency mask:              This attribute is a bit map of the centre frequencies that the interface is
                             permitted to use, where each bit represents a centre frequency. The least
                             significant bit (b[1]) corresponds to centre frequency 800 MHz. The next
                             significant bit (b[2]) corresponds to centre frequency 825 MHz. The
                             28th bit (b[28]) corresponds to a centre frequency 1500 MHz. The
                             4 most significant bits are not used. (R, W) (optional) (4 bytes)
RF channel:                  This attribute reports the frequency to which the MoCA interface is

9.11     Traffic management
9.11.1 Priority queue-G
This managed entity specifies the priority queue used by a GEM port network CTP. In the upstream
direction, a priority queue-G ME is also related to a T-CONT ME.
If N priority queues reside in the ONT and its circuit packs, the ONT creates N instances of the
priority queue-G management entity following the creation of the circuit pack or T-CONT MEs.
After the ONT creates T-CONT MEs, it autonomously creates instances of the priority queue-G
ME.
The OLT can find all the queues by reading the priority queue-G managed entity instances. If the
OLT tries to retrieve a non-existent priority queue, the ONT denies the get action with an error
indication.
See also Appendix III.
Upstream priority queues can be added to the ONT. Moreover, priority queues can exist in the ONT
core and circuit packs serving both UNI and ANI functions.
The weight attribute permits configuring an optional traffic scheduler. Several attributes support
back pressure operation, whereby a back pressure signal is sent backward and causes the attached
terminal to temporarily suspend sending data.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity are associated with the ONT-G managed entity to
model the upstream priority queues if the traffic management option attribute in the ONT-G ME
is 0.
One or more instances of this managed entity are associated with a circuit pack managed entity
serving UNI functions as downstream priority queues.
For an ONT that has one or more fixed user interfaces, one or more instances are associated with
the ONT-G managed entity for the downstream priority queues.
Attributes
Managed entity id:           This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                             The most significant bit represents the direction (1: upstream,
                             0: downstream). The 15 least significant bits represent a queue id. The
                             queue id is numbered in ascending order by the ONT itself. It is
                             strongly encouraged that the queue id be formulated to simplify finding
                             related queues. One way to do this is to number the queues such that the
                             related port attributes are in ascending order (for the downstream and
                             upstream queues separately). The range of downstream queue ids is 0 to
                             0x7FFF and the range of upstream queue ids is 0x8000 to 0xFFFF. (R)
                             (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Queue configuration   This attribute identifies the buffer partitioning policy. The value 1
option:               means that several queues share one buffer size of maximum queue
                      size, while the value 0 means that each queue has an individual buffer
                      of maximum queue size. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Maximum queue size:   This attribute specifies the maximum size of the queue. Units are GEM
                      block lengths. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Allocated queue size: This attribute identifies the allocated size of this queue. Units are GEM
                      block lengths. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Discard-block counter This attribute represents the interval in milliseconds at which the
reset interval:       counter resets itself. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
Threshold value for   The threshold for the number of GEM block lengths discarded on this
discarded blocks due  queue due to buffer overflow. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)

Related port:         This attribute represents the slot, port/T-CONT and priority information
                      associated with the instance of priority queue-G ME. This attribute
                      comprises four bytes.
                      In the upstream direction, the first two bytes are the ME ID of the
                      associated T-CONT. In the downstream direction, the first byte is the
                      slot number and the second byte is the port number of the queue's
                      destination port.
                      The last two bytes represent the priority of this queue. The range of
                      priority is 0 to 0x0FFF. The value 0 indicates the highest priority and
                      0x0FFF indicates the lowest priority. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Traffic scheduler-G   This attribute points to the traffic scheduler-G ME instance that is
pointer:              associated with this priority queue. This pointer is used when this
                      priority queue is connected with a traffic scheduler. The default value is
                      null (0). (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Weight:               This attribute represents weight for WRR. This weight is used by the
                      traffic scheduler or T-CONT (whose policy is WRR) indicated by the
                      traffic scheduler-G pointer attribute or related port attribute. Upon ME
                      instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 1. (R, W) (mandatory)
                      (1 byte)
Back pressure         This attribute enables (0) or disables (1) back pressure operation. Its
operation:            default value is 0. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Back pressure time:   This attribute indicates the time for which the customer terminal
                      temporarily suspends sending data. This attribute presents the duration
                      in microseconds. This attribute can be used as a pause time for an
                      Ethernet UNI. Values: 0 to 0xFFFF FFFF. Upon ME instantiation, the
                      ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Back pressure occur   This attribute identifies the threshold size of this queue to start sending
queue threshold:      a back pressure signal. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Back pressure clear   This attribute identifies the threshold size of this queue to stop sending a
queue threshold:      back pressure signal. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)

9.11.2 Traffic scheduler-G
An instance of this managed entity represents a logical object that can control upstream GEM
packets. A traffic scheduler can accommodate GEM packets after a priority queue or other traffic
scheduler and transfer them toward the next traffic scheduler or T-CONT. Because T-CONTs and
traffic schedulers are created autonomously by the ONT, the ONT vendor predetermines the most
complex traffic handling model it is prepared to support; the OLT may use less than the ONT's full
capabilities, but cannot ask for more. See Appendix III for more detail.
After the ONT creates instances of T-CONT ME, it then autonomously creates instances of the
traffic scheduler-G ME.
Relationships
The traffic scheduler-G ME may be related to a T-CONT or other traffic schedulers through pointer
attributes.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         This two-byte number indicates the physical capability that realizes the
                         traffic scheduler. The first byte is the slot id of the circuit pack with which
                         this traffic scheduler is associated. For a traffic scheduler that is not
                         associated with a circuit pack, the first byte is 0xFF. The second byte is the
                         traffic scheduler id, assigned by the ONT itself. Traffic scheduler ids are
                         numbered in ascending order with range 0..0xFF in each circuit pack or
                         ONT core. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
T-CONT pointer:          This attribute points to the T-CONT ME instance associated with this
                         traffic scheduler. This pointer is used when this traffic scheduler is
                         connected to the T-CONT directly. It is null (0) otherwise. (R)
                         (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Traffic scheduler        This attribute points to another traffic scheduler-G ME instance that may

9.12     General purpose MEs
9.12.1 UNI-G
This managed entity organizes data associated with user network interfaces (UNIs) supported by
GEM. One instance of the UNI-G managed entity exists for each UNI supported by the ONT.
The ONT automatically creates or deletes instances of this managed entity upon the creation or
deletion of a real or virtual circuit pack managed entity, one per port.
Relationships
An instance of the UNI-G managed entity exists for each instance of a physical path termination
point managed entity.
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of a physical path termination point. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)

9.12.2 OLT-G
NOTE – Except for its name, this managed entity is identical to the OLTB-PON ME documented in
[ITU-T G.983.2].
This optional managed entity identifies the OLT to which an ONT is connected. This ME provides
a way for the ONT to configure itself for operability with a particular OLT.
An ONT that supports this managed entity automatically creates an instance of it. Immediately
following the startup phase, the OLT should set the ONT to the desired configuration. Interpretation
of the attributes is a matter for negotiation between the two vendors involved.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity is associated with the ONT managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
OLT vendor id:           This attribute identifies the OLT vendor. It is the same as the 4 most
                         significant bytes of an ONT serial number specified in [ITU-T G.984.3].
                         Upon instantiation, this attribute comprises all spaces. (R, W) (mandatory)
                         (4 bytes)
Equipment id:            This attribute may be used to identify the specific type of OLT. The
                         default value of all spaces indicates that equipment ID information is not
                         available or applicable to the OLT being represented. (R, W) (mandatory)
                         (20 bytes)
Version:                 This attribute identifies the version of the OLT as defined by the vendor.
                         The default left-justified ASCII string "0" (padded with trailing nulls)
                         indicates that version information is not available or applicable to the OLT
                         being represented. (R, W) (mandatory) (14 bytes)

9.12.3 Network address
The network address managed entity associates a network address with security methods required to
access a server. It is conditionally required for ONTs that support VoIP service. The address may
take the form of a URI, a fully qualified path or IP address represented as an ACII string.
If a non-OMCI interface is used to manage VoIP signalling, this ME is unnecessary. The
non-OMCI interface supplies the necessary data, which may be read back to the OLT via the SIP
config portal ME or the MGC config portal ME.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT or the ONT depending on the
method used and case.
Relationships
Any managed entity that requires a network address may link to an instance of this ME.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         Instances of this managed entity created autonomously by the ONT have
                         IDs in the range 0..0x7FFF. Instances created by the OLT have IDs in the
                         range 0x8000..0xFFFE. The value 0xFFFF is not valid. (R,
                         Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Security pointer:        If this attribute is set to its default value 0xFFFF, security attributes are not
                         defined for this network address. If this attribute is set to any other value, it
                         points to an authentication security method managed entity. The
                         authentication security method indicates the username and password to be
                         used when retrieving the network address indicated by this ME. (R, W,
                         Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                         address. It may contain a fully qualified domain name, URI or IP address.
                         The URI may also contain an optional port identifier (e.g.,
                         "x.y.z.com:5060"). The default value 0xFFFF indicates that no network
                         address is defined. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes).

9.12.4 Authentication security method
The authentication security method defines the user id/password configuration to establish a session
between a client and server. This object may be used in the role of the client or server. An instance
of this managed entity is created by the OLT if authenticated communication is necessary.
Relationships
One instance of this management entity may be associated with a network address ME. This ME
may also be cited by other MEs that require authentication parameter management.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                         value 0xFFFF is not valid. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Validation scheme:       This attribute specifies the validation scheme used when the ONT
                         validates a challenge. Validation schemes are defined as follows:
                         0 Validation disabled.
                         1 Validate using MD5 digest authentication as defined in
                             [IETF RFC 2069] (recommended).
                         3 Validate using basic authentication as defined in [IETF RFC 2617].
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Username 1:              This string attribute is the user name. If the string is shorter than 25 bytes,
                         it must be null terminated (Note). (R, W) (mandatory) (25 bytes)
Password:                This string attribute is the password. If the string is shorter than 25 bytes, it
                         must be null terminated. (R, W) (mandatory) (25 bytes)
Realm:                   This string attribute specifies the realm used in digest authentication. If the
                         string is shorter than 25 bytes, it must be null terminated. (R, W)
                         (mandatory) (25 bytes)
Username 2:              This string attribute allows for continuation of the user name beyond
                         25 characters (Note). Its default value is a null string. (R, W) (optional)
                         (25 bytes)
NOTE − The total username is the concatenation of the username 1 and username 2 attributes if and only if
a) username 1 comprises 25 non-null characters, b) username 2 is supported by the ONT, and c) username 2
contains a leading non-null character string. Otherwise, the total username is simply the value of the
username 1 attribute.

9.12.5 Large string
The large string managed entity holds strings longer than 25 bytes, up to 375 bytes. It is maintained
in up to 15 parts, each part containing 25 bytes. If the final part contains fewer than 25 bytes, it is
terminated by at least one null byte. For example:
           Number of parts          3
           Part 1                   sftp://myusername:mypassw
           Part 2                   ord@config.telecom.com:12

           Part 3                   34/path/to/longfilename<null>
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT. To use this managed entity,
the OLT instantiates the large string ME and then points to the created ME from other ME
instances. Systems that maintain the large string should ensure that the large string ME is not
deleted while it is still linked.
Relationships
An instance of this ME may be cited by any ME that requires a text string longer than 25 bytes.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                            value 0xFFFF is not valid. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Number of parts:            This attribute specifies the number of non-empty parts that form the large
                            string. This attribute defaults to 0 to indicate no large string is defined.
                            (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte).
Fifteen additional attributes are defined below; they are identical. The large string is simply divided
into as many parts as necessary, starting at part 1. If the end of the string does not lie at a part
boundary, it is marked with a null byte.

                        This number is the same that appears in the attributes table in the managed
                        entity ME. Only one instance of each unique attribute need be created. The
                        ONT can assign attribute numbering as it pleases, out of the pool of 64K
                        ids; however, it is suggested that the numbering follow a rational scheme
                        to aid human readability. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Name:                   This attribute contains a 25-byte mnemonic tag for the attribute. Strings
                        shorter than 25 bytes are padded with null characters. (R) (mandatory)
                        (25 bytes)
Size:                   This attribute contains the size of the attribute, in bytes. The value 0
                        indicates that the attribute can have a variable/unknown size. (R)
                        (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Access:                 This attribute represents the OMCI access characteristics of the attribute.
                        The following code points are defined:
                        1    Read.
                        2    Write.
                        3    Read, write.
                        5    Read, Set-by-create.

                        (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Format:                 This attribute represents the format of the attribute. The following code
                        points are defined:
                        1    Pointer.
                        2    Bit field.
                        3    Signed integer.
                        4    Unsigned integer.
                        5    String.
                        6    Enumeration (that is, a set of defined code points).
                        7    Table.
                        (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                            types (pointer, signed integer, unsigned integer) only. For attributes
                            smaller than 4 bytes, the desired numeric value is expressed in 4-byte
                            representation (e.g., the signed one-byte integer 0xFE is expressed as
                            0xFFFF FFFE; the unsigned one-byte integer 0xFE is expressed as
                            0x0000 00FE). (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Upper limit:                This attribute provides the highest value for the attribute. It has the same
                            validity and format as the lower limit attribute. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Bit field:                  This attribute is a mask of the supported bits in a bit field attribute. Valid
                            for bit field type only. A 1 in any position signifies that its code point is
                            supported, while 0 indicates not supported. For bit fields smaller than
                            4 bytes, the attribute is aligned at the least significant end of the mask. (R)
                            (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Code points table:          This attribute lists the code points supported by an enumerated attribute.

Support:                    This attribute represents the level of support of the attribute (same notation
                            as the attribute of the same name in the ME). The following code points
                            are defined:
                            1   Fully supported (supported as defined in this object).
                            2   Unsupported (OMCI returns an error code if accessed).
                            3   Partially supported (some aspects of attribute supported).
                            4   Ignored (OMCI supported, but underlying function is not).

9.12.11 Octet string
The octet string is modelled on the large string managed entity. The large string is constrained to
printable characters because it uses null as a trailing delimiter. The octet string has a length attribute
and is therefore suitable for arbitrary sequences of bytes.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT. To use this managed entity,
the OLT instantiates the octet string ME and then points to the created ME from other ME
instances. Systems that maintain the octet string should ensure that the octet string ME is not
deleted while it is still linked.
Relationships
An instance of this ME may be cited by any ME that requires an octet string that can exceed 25
bytes in length.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                            values 0 and 0xFFFF are reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                            (2 bytes)
                         octets. This attribute defaults to 0 to indicate no octet string is defined. The
                         maximum value of this attribute is 375 (15 parts, 25 bytes each). (R, W)
                         (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Fifteen additional attributes are defined below; they are identical. The octet string is simply divided
into as many parts as necessary, starting at part 1 and left justified.
Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, Part 7, Part 8, Part 9, Part 10, Part 11, Part 12,
Part 13, Part 14, Part 15: (R, W) (part 1 mandatory, others optional) (25 bytes * 15 attributes)

9.12.12 General purpose buffer
This managed entity is created by the OLT when needed to store the results of an operation, such as
a test command, that needs to return a block of data of indeterminate size. The buffer is retrieved
with get next operations, since its size is not known a priori. An instance of this ME is created and
deleted by the OLT, and typically made known to an ONT ME or action through a pointer.
The ME is defined as generically as possible, such that it can be used for other applications that
may not initially be apparent, such as logging. The format of its contents is specific to each
application, and is documented there.
The general purpose buffer is neither captured in a MIB upload, nor retained in non-volatile ONT
memory.
Relationships
Through a pointer, the OLT may associate a general purpose buffer with an ME and/or an operation
that has a need to create large or indeterminate blocks of data for subsequent upload.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Maximum size:            The ONT determines the actual size of the buffer table in the process of
                         capturing the data directed to it. The maximum size attribute permits the
                         OLT to restrict the maximum size of the buffer table. The default value 0
                         indicates that the OLT imposes no limit on the size; it is recognized that
                         ONT implementations will impose their own limits. The ONT will not
                         create a buffer table larger than this value. If the ONT cannot allocate
                         enough memory to accommodate this size, it should deny the ME creation
                         action or a write operation that attempts to expand an existing ME. (R, W,
                         Set-by-create) (optional) (4 bytes)
Buffer table:            This attribute is an octet string that contains the result of some operation
                         performed on the ONT. The exact content depends on the operation, and is
                         documented with the definition of each operation. (R) (mandatory)

9.13     Miscellaneous services
9.13.1 Physical path termination point video UNI
This managed entity represents an RF video UNI in the ONT, where physical paths terminate and
physical path level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•        When the ONT has RF video UNI ports built into its factory configuration.
•        When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of video UNI type.
•        When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of video
         UNI type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of
         video ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to
         instantiate a port mapping package that specifies video ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a video circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a video circuit pack.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a real or virtual
circuit pack classified as video type.

9.13.2 Physical path termination point video ANI
This managed entity represents an RF video ANI in the ONT, where physical paths terminate and
physical path level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•        When the ONT has video ANI ports built into its factory configuration.
•        When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of video ANI type.
•        When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of video
         ANI type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of
         video ANI ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to
         instantiate a port mapping package that specifies video ANI ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a video ANI circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a video ANI circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a real or preprovisioned video
ANI port.

AGC mode:             This attribute allows the discovery and configuration of the ONT's AGC
                      capabilities. The attribute contains a codepoint for several AGC types. The
                      ONT displays the currently used AGC mode. The OLT can discover new
                      modes via the set command; the ONT denies attempts to set an
                      unsupported mode. The code points are:
                      0              No AGC.
                      1              Broadband RF AGC.

                      (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
AGC setting:          This attribute indicates the measurement offset that the ONT should use in
                      AGC. The attribute has a step size of 0.1 dB, represented as a signed
                      integer.
                      The theoretical nominal RF signal is 80 channels of NTSC video, each
                      having a per-channel optical modulation index of 3.5%. An ONT
                      presented with such a signal should produce its specified output when this
                      attribute is set to zero.
                      If total optical power is used for AGC, this attribute provides the OMI
                      offset for any NTSC carriers present from the theoretical 3.5% value. For
                      example, if the actual signal uses an OMI of 7.0% per channel (3 dB
                      higher), then the ONT should be given an AGC setting of 30
                      (coded 0x1E).
                      If broadband RF power is used for AGC, this attribute provides the total
                      power offset for any NTSC carriers present from the theoretical 80 channel
                      value. For example, if an actual signal contains 40 NTSC channels (3 dB
                      lower), then the ONT should be given an AGC setting of –30 (coded
                      0xE2).
                      (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Video lower optical   This attribute specifies the optical level used to declare the video OOR low
threshold:            alarm. Valid values are –12 to +6 dBm in 0.1 dB increments, represented
                      as a 2s complement integer (coding –120 to +60, where 0x00 = 0 dBm,
                      0x88 = –12.0 dBm, etc.). Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this
                      attribute to 0xA1 (–9.5 dBm). (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
                      NOTE – Because the power measurement returned in the optical signal level
                      attribute has a resolution of 1 dB, it is possible that the measured value could
                      appear to be in-range, even though an out-of-range alarm has been declared
                      against a threshold with 0.1 dB resolution.
Video upper optical   This attribute specifies the optical level used to declare the video OOR
threshold:            high alarm. Valid values are –12 to +6 dBm in 0.1 dB increments,
                      represented as a 2s complement integer (coding –120 to +60,
                      0x00 = 0dBm, 0x88 = –12.0 dBm, etc.). Upon ME instantiation, the ONT
                      sets this attribute to 0x19 (+2.5 dBm). (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)

9.13.3 Physical path termination point LCT UNI
This managed entity represents the local craft terminal UNI, where physical paths terminate and
physical path level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•         When the ONT has LCT ports built into its factory configuration.
•         When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of LCT type.
•         When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of LCT
          type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of LCT
          ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
          port mapping package that specifies LCT ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an LCT circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an LCT circuit pack.
LCT instances are not reported during a MIB upload.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a real or virtual circuit pack
managed entity classified as LCT type.

10       ONT management and control channel (OMCC)
A GEM connection shall be provisioned for the OMCC (the use of ATM mode is deprecated).
[ITU-T G.984.3] specifies a PLOAM message that activates a PortID between the OLT and ONT
processors. The PortID value for the management channel of each ONT is programmed by the OLT
using this message. A grant flow must be allocated by the MAC layer of the OLT for upstream
OMCC traffic of each ONT.
The following performance requirements related to the OMCC are considered with input from
operators:
a)       The upstream traffic on each OMCC should not exceed x bandwidth, where x is based on
         the operator's requirement.
b)       An upstream OMCC packet should always be put in the high priority queue; the constraints
         on the downstream OMCC packets are out of the scope of this Recommendation, as this is
         completely under control of the OLT.
c)        Message response time: The system should support response times that do not exceed
          one second for high priority protocol handling messages and three seconds for low priority
          protocol handling messages.
11        ONT management and control protocol
11.1      ONT management and control protocol packet format
11.1.1 Introduction
In GEM mode, each ONT management and control protocol packet is encapsulated directly in a
GEM packet. The packet format is shown in Figure 11.1.1-1. Packet contents reflect the ATM
heritage of B-PON; only the header is changed. The OMCI trailer is retained and used for its CRC.
The following clauses discuss the details.

                    (2 bytes)
              Figure 11.1.1-1 – ONT management and control protocol packet format
11.1.2 GEM header
The header contains the PortID (GEM mode) of the OMCC for the addressed ONT (see clause 10).
The header PTI should equal 000 or 001 for GEM (as per normal fragmentation rules).
11.1.3 Transaction correlation identifier
The transaction correlation identifier is used to associate a request message with its response
message. For request messages, the OLT selects any transaction identifier. A response message
carries the transaction identifier of the message to which it is responding. The transaction identifier
of event messages is 0x0000.
As explained in clause 11.2, the most significant bit of the transaction correlation identifier
indicates the priority of the message. The following coding is used: 0 = low priority, 1 = high
priority. The OLT decides whether a command should be executed with low or high priority.
The mechanism that the OLT uses to assign the rest of the bits of the transaction correlation
identifier in an acknowledged command is not standardized and is left to the implementers.
However, since the transaction correlation identifier is used to match a command from the OLT to
the ONT with a response from the ONT to the OLT, some care is required in the choice of the
transaction correlation identifier. The OLT must assign the transaction correlation identifier in such
a way that, whenever it sends a command with a transaction correlation identifier that has been used
before in another command to the same ONT, it is guaranteed with sufficiently high probability that
no response for the first command will be received.
11.1.4 Message type
The message type field is subdivided into four parts. These are given in Figure 11.1.4-1.
                     8           7        6      5                                   1

                              Figure 11.1.4-1 – Message type field subdivision
The most significant bit, bit 8, is reserved for the destination bit (DB). In the OMCI this bit is
always 0.
Bit 7, acknowledge request (AR), indicates whether or not the message requires an
acknowledgement. If an acknowledgement is expected, this bit is set to 1. If no acknowledgement is
expected, the coding of this bit is 0. Note that "acknowledge" means a response to an action request,
not an acknowledgement at the link layer.
Bit 6, acknowledgement (AK), indicates whether or not this message is an acknowledgement to an
action request. If a message is an acknowledgement, this bit is set to 1. If the message is not a
response, this bit is set to 0.
Bits 5..1, message type (MT), indicate the message type. Codes 0 to 3 and 29 to 31 are reserved for
future use. Codes 4 to 28 are used by this specification. Table 11-1 lists the message types that are
defined.

11.1.5 Device identifier
For systems based on this Recommendation, this field is defined as 0x0A.
11.1.6 Message identifier
The message identifier consists of four bytes. The first, most significant, two bytes of the message
identifier field are used to indicate which managed entity is the target of the action specified in the
message type. The maximum number of possible managed entities is thus 65535. The least
significant two bytes of this message identifier field are used to identify the managed entity
instance. The number of bytes for each managed entity instance is defined in clause 9. The
summation of the number of bytes in the message identifier field and the number of bytes available
in the message contents field shall be 36 bytes because the ONT management and control protocol
packet format is 53 bytes long.
Table 11-2 gives the managed entities and their class values in the OMCI. Depending on the
managed entity, there will be only one (e.g., ONT-G) or several (e.g., MAC bridge port config data)
instances in an ONT. Note that this table contains all the managed entities ever standardized for
OMCI, including G.983 series and ATM features now deprecated, because all these class values
will remain reserved forever. The class values defined in the G.983-series were only one byte, and
so they are padded with a leading 0x00 byte to make them two-byte values usable in G-PON.

11.1.7 Message contents
The layout of the message contents field is message-specific. The detailed layout of all messages is
given in Appendix II.
11.1.8 OMCI trailer
AAL5 trailer is reused in this field. The eight bytes of this field are used as follows:
a)        The first two bytes are set to 0x0000 at the transmitter and ignored at the receiver (they
          correspond to CPCS-UU and CPI).
b)        The length of the CPCS-SDU field is set to 0x0028.
c)        The 32-bit CRC is as specified in [ITU-T I.363.5].
11.1.9 OMCI size limitations
Due to the arrangement of the messages, the OMCI imposes limits on the size of the message
payloads. Table 11-3 lists the important limits for both B-PON and G-PON usages of the OMCI. To
enable re-use of managed entities over both B-PON and G-PON, it is important that all MEs are
defined such that they fit into the G-PON limits.
                                  Table 11-3 – OMCI protocol limitations
                              Item                                    Limited by             G-PON limit

  Size of (R) or (R,W) simple attribute                     Get response                          25
  Size of (R) or (R,W) table entry                          Set                                   30
  Total size of a get                                       Get response                          25
  Total size of a get current data                          Get current data response             25
It is important that the OLT and ONT implementations take these limits into account. For example,
it is very easy to form a 'get' command that asks the ONT to return more attributes than there is
space in the response message.
If the OLT asks for too many attributes, and the ONT can respond with however many attributes fit
in its 25-byte attribute space. The OLT will get the appropriate attribute-present mask and will parse
the attributes that were sent correctly. It will ask again later for those attributes that did not fit.
While this is the preferred behaviour, an alternate interpretation may be that the ONT would return
a "parameter error" code when it receives a get that does not fit in the get response. For the sake of
interoperability, the expected behaviour between and OLT and ONT with different interpretations is
provided below:
Case 1. The ONT reports a parameter error, and the OLT expects a partial list. If this happens, the
          OLT should react by simplifying its get request. The ONT will then respond without an
          error.
Case 2. The ONT provides a partial list, while the OLT expects to get an error. The OLT will
          receive a normal message and will process it normally. The OLT should ask again for any
          attributes it did not get.
11.1.10 Test result enumeration
Test actions can return measurements of various physical parameters in vendor-specific ways.
Table 11-4 identifies parameters that may be of interest, with enumerated values to represent them
in the test response message defined in Appendix II.
The resolution shown in the following descriptions merely indicates the weight attached to the least
significant bit, and is not intended to impose requirements for precision or accuracy of the measured
value.

11.2     Message flow control and error recovery
The flow control/error recovery procedures for message exchange over the OMCC are based upon a
simplex acknowledged transaction stop-and-wait mechanism that can easily be extended to support
concurrent execution of multiple transaction requests of different priority levels. These flow-control
procedures ensure that a low level acknowledged transaction request transmitted from the OLT has
been properly received and processed to completion by the ONT before the next message of the
same priority level is sent by the OLT. The stop-and-wait protocol uses the transaction correlation
identifier field, retry counter(s), and applicable transaction request timer(s) to control the message
flow rate while relying upon a CRC calculation to verify the data integrity of all received messages.
A transaction request timer Ti with expiration time Tmaxi is started when a transaction request
message of priority level "i" is sent to an ONT and is stopped upon receipt of an error-free
acknowledgement message containing the same transaction correlation id value. If a valid
acknowledgement message is not received by the OLT after timer Ti expires, the OLT re-sends the
original transaction request message.
A retransmitted acknowledged transaction request message carries the same correlation ID as the
original message. Each time an acknowledged transaction request message is retransmitted by the
OLT, the transmitter increments the retry counter Ri (the counter associated with priority level "i"
acknowledged transaction requests). When a retry counter Ri (initialized to 0x00 upon start-up)
reaches the maximum retry value, Rmaxi, the transmitter stops re-transmitting the message and
declares an OMCC link state error.
Note that these timers (Ti) and retry counters (Ri) are only maintained within the OLT controller
and do not exist within the ONT. Furthermore, the default threshold values for timer expiration
(Tmaxi) and number of retries (Rmaxi) are not subject to standardization. It is suggested that the
default threshold values of both Tmax and Rmax be independently configurable for each priority
level. The default value for Tmax1 (i.e., high priority threshold) should account for the typical
message transmission delay plus the command message response time.
These flow control/error recovery procedures are illustrated in Figure 11.2-1 for a case where the
OMCC link is not permanently broken. First, the OLT sends an acknowledged transaction request
(message 1) with priority level 0. Subsequently (i.e., while message 1 is still outstanding), the OLT
issues an additional acknowledged transaction request (message 2) with priority level 1. Both of
these commands are received and executed with the associated response (acknowledgement
messages) returned to the OLT by the ONT. The acknowledgement for message 1 is received by the
OLT in time, however the response to message 2 is lost and never received. The OLT detects that
something went wrong because timer T1 expires, and the OLT therefore retransmits the original
command (message 2). Note that the ONT detects that this retransmitted command is identical to
the last received command (for priority level 1) and therefore does not re-execute it. The ONT
simply retransmits the original response from the previous execution of message 2, which reaches
the OLT in time. Finally, the OLT sends an acknowledged transaction request (message 3) with
priority level 0, but the message itself gets lost and is never properly received by the ONT. After the
associated timer (T0) expires, the OLT retransmits the command and now all goes well.
               Figure 11.2-1 – Concurrent Message Exchange with Error Recovery
A case where the OMCC link is effectively broken (down) is shown in Figure 11.2-2.

11.3      OMCI handling within the ONT
11.3.1 Prioritized protocol entities
This clause specifies the behaviour of the ONT more precisely than in the preceding clause with
respect to the prioritized request mechanism of the OMCC.
Conceptually, the way the ONT handles the OMCC requests can be illustrated by referring to the
dual priority level implementation example shown in Figure 11.3.1-1.
When the ONT receives a GEM packet via the GEM port associated with the management channel,
it shall calculate the CRC and compare it with the value found in the OMCI trailer. If the values do
not match, the ONT shall discard the message. It is recommended that this event be logged by the
ONT and possibly communicated to the OLT by some out-of-band mechanism but, as far as the
protocol is concerned, the message is discarded silently.
Messages with a correct CRC are then placed into either of two distinct incoming FIFO-based
message queues, according to the priority level (i.e., high or low) of the associated command. Note
that the priority level of a given command is encoded using the most significant bit of the
transaction correlation identifier field. If the associated incoming message queue is already full, the
ONT must simply discard the message. It is recommended that this event be logged by the ONT and
possibly communicated to the OLT by some out-of-band mechanism but, as far as the protocol is
concerned, the message is discarded silently.
There are two distinct incoming command processing protocol entities (one associated with each
priority level) that are used to service messages sequentially from an independently associated
incoming FIFO queue. Each of these protocol entities can execute concurrently. If a message is a
one-way command (i.e., an unacknowledged command), the protocol entity will simply have the
command executed. If a message is an acknowledged command, the protocol entity must first look
at the transaction correlation identifier. If it is not equal to the transaction correlation identifier of
the last executed command with the same priority level, the protocol entity will have the command
executed and place the response/acknowledgement (with identical transaction correlation identifier)
in the outgoing FIFO queue of the same priority level. If the transaction correlation identifier is
equal to that of the last executed command with the same priority level (i.e., the case where the
controller retransmits a command due to lack of proper acknowledgement), the protocol entity will
not actually have the command executed but simply will place the response from the last execution
of that command in the outgoing FIFO queue (i.e., re-send the previous acknowledgement
response). It is assumed that in both cases the command processing protocol entity for a given
priority level will block until there is room in the associated outgoing FIFO queue for the response
message.
In the other direction, requests by the applications to send autonomous event notifications will
simply result in the corresponding messages being directed to an event notification protocol entity
for transmission to the OLT. The event notification protocol entity will forward these event
notification messages to the low priority outgoing FIFO queue. In this case as well, the event
notification protocol entity will block until there is room in the low priority outgoing FIFO queue to
hold the notification message. The CRC generator will remove messages from the outgoing FIFO
queues using a strict priority discipline (i.e., the low-priority queue will only be served when the
high-priority queue is empty), generate a CRC, append a properly-formatted OMCI trailer to the
packet payload, and transmit the message to the OLT.
                          Figure 11.3.1-1 – Protocol entities within the ONT
11.3.2 Restrictions on the actions in relation to the protocol entities
To reduce the complexity and the amount of memory necessary in the ONT, the OLT is not allowed
to issue a MIB upload or a software download of a certain priority level while a similar action in the
other priority level is in progress.
11.3.3 Usage of the default alloc-id
The OMCC is carried in the upstream in the default allocation ID. In some implementations, the
default alloc-id is also used for user traffic, and is associated with a T-CONT ME. In these cases,
the OMCC traffic is combined with the T-CONT traffic using a simple strict-priority multiplexing,
with the OMCC having higher priority.

                           OMCI common mechanisms and services
                (This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation)
This appendix describes the common mechanisms of the OMCI, e.g., the MIB resynchronization,
and the OMCI services, e.g., the equipment management or connection management.
I.1       Common mechanisms
The common mechanisms consist of:
a)        MIB data sync increase.
b)        MIB audit and resynchronization.
c)        Alarm sequence number increase.
d)        Alarm audit and resynchronization.
e)        Get an attribute that is larger than the OMCI message contents field.
f)        Create an instance of a managed entity with an attribute that is larger than the OMCI
          message contents field.
g)        Reporting of test result.
h)        Alarm reporting control.
These common mechanisms are explained by the use of scenario diagrams.
I.1.1     MIB data sync increase
The MIB at the OLT and the instances of the managed entities in the ONT have to be synchronized
at all times. This clause describes the means for achieving this. The "tool" used for this is the MIB
data sync attribute of the ONT data managed entity.
The MIB data sync attribute is a global eight-bit sequence number. When auditing the MIB in the
ONT, the OLT requests this sequence number. If this number coincides with the corresponding
sequence number in the OLT, no further action is needed, as the two MIBs, in ONT and OLT, are
thought to be identical. If there is a discrepancy, the OLT either 1) downloads its copy (including
the MIB data sync) of the MIB to the ONT, or 2) uploads the MIB of the ONT, compares it with its
own MIB, sends the necessary commands to the ONT to correct the differences and downloads its
sequence number.
The ONT will be audited with respect to its MIB in three cases:
a)        On loss and re-establishment of the OMCC.
b)        Periodically, based on the operator's requirements.
c)        On demand of the OpS.
On detecting a newly installed ONT, regardless of the sequence number of its MIB, the OLT will
perform either a MIB audit followed by whatever modifications are required, or a MIB reset and
ONT startup procedure (see clause I.2.1).
The MIB data sync counter will be incremented for the creation and deletion of managed entity
instances that are the consequence of a command by the OLT. The MIB data sync counter will also
be incremented for attribute value changes which are the consequence of a command by the OLT.
The MIB data sync counter will be incremented once per executed command (see Figures I.1.1-1
and I.1.1-2).
deletion of managed entity instances by the ONT itself. Neither will the MIB data sync counter be
incremented for autonomous changes to attributes of managed entities within the ONT (see
Figures I.1.1-3 and I.1.1-4).
The order in which the OLT and the ONT will update their MIBs and increment the MIB data sync
is not imposed. However, both the OLT and the ONT must locally update the MIB and increment
the MIB data sync as one atomic action.
When incremented, the sequence number that follows 255 is 1. 0x00 is reserved for the following
cases:
a)       Default MIB with which the ONT left the factory.
b)       An ONT which after (re-)initialization cannot restore its MIB.
In other words, a sequence number of 0 indicates that the ONT's MIB is not well defined, and
therefore requires audit/reconfiguration.
Note that no mechanisms exist to detect that an autonomous attribute value change notification has
been lost. Therefore, the OLT must regularly read the values of the attributes that can change their
values autonomously.

            Figure I.1.1-4 – No increment of MIB data sync at ONT and OLT in case
                              of autonomous attribute value changes
I.1.2    MIB audit and resynchronization
Figures I.1.2-1 and I.1.2-2 show the scenario diagram of the MIB audit and MIB resynchronization
process.
                        Figure I.1.2-1 – Audit and MIB resynchronization
                         Figure I.1.2-2 – Audit and MIB resynchronization
The OLT must issue as many MIBUploadNext requests as the number of instances given in the
MIBUpload response. The maximum time between two MIBUploadNext requests is 1 minute. If
the OLT does not send a MIBUploadNext request within this time after the previous
MIBUploadNext request or after the MIBUpload start request, the ONT assumes the MIB upload to
be terminated. The ONT can drop the copy of the MIB, and consider any MIBUploadNext requests
to be out of range, as described in clause II.2.22.
It should be noted that certain MEs and attributes are not to be included in the MIB audit. This is for
reasons of efficiency and protocol simplification. In particular, instances of all performance
management MEs and the managed entity ME and the Attribute ME should not be included in the
MIB audit. All table attributes should not be included in the MIB audit, even though their parent
ME is included. If the OLT requires this information, it will obtain it by directly reading it.
I.1.3    Alarm sequence number increase
The ONT informs the OLT of alarm status changes by sending alarm status change notifications.
Note that these notifications are sent in unacknowledged messages that carry an eight-bit alarm
sequence number for the benefit of the OLT to detect loss of alarm notifications (Figures I.1.3-1 and
I.1.3-2). After a restart of the ONT, the alarm sequence number is reset so that the first alarm
notification sent by the ONT will have an alarm sequence number equal to 1. The alarm message
sequence number is incremented for each alarm notification and wraps around from 255 to 1.
Consequently, an alarm notification with sequence number 0x00 will never be sent.
             Figure I.1.3-1 – Increment of alarm sequence number at ONT and OLT
             Figure I.1.3-2 – Increment of alarm sequence number at ONT and OLT
I.1.4    Alarm audit and resynchronization
When the OLT detects a gap in the received sequence, as shown in Figure I.1.4-1, it asks the ONT
for an alarm status report by sending a "get all active alarms" command targeted at the "ONT data"
ME. Obviously, this command is acknowledged by a response that contains the number of managed
entity instances that have outstanding alarms. The OLT will request the alarm status of all these
managed entities instances via the "get all alarms next" command targeted at the ONT data ME.
The OLT will compare these alarm statuses of all these instances with its own and will notify the
network manager of the changes. The alarm sequence number is reset by the ONT when it receives
the "get all active alarms" request.
                      Figure I.1.4-1 – Audit and alarm resynchronization
The OLT must issue as many GetAllAlarmsNext requests as the number of instances given in the
GetAllAlarms start response. The maximum time between two GetAllAlarmsNext requests is
one minute. If the OLT does not send a GetAllAlarmsNext request within this time after the
previous GetAllAlarmsNext request or after the GetAllAlarms start request, the ONT assumes the
alarm upload to be terminated. The ONT can drop the copy of the alarm table, and consider any
GetAllAlarmsNext requests to be out of range, as described in clause II.2.18.
I.1.5    Table attributes
Normal attributes are coded such that they do not exceed the maximum OMCI attribute size.
However, there are cases where attributes need to be larger because they comprise arrays of data. In
other cases, the attribute may be unstructured, but nevertheless be too large to be represented as a
conventional attribute. Both types of large attributes are known as tables, and can be identified by
the word "table" in their name.
For all such attributes, the 'set' action is used to set a single entry in the table, the size of which is
specified in clause 9 for the particular attribute in question. This is possible only when individual
table entries do not exceed the maximum size that can be conveyed in the set operation. Otherwise,
the table attribute is restricted to being read-only.
The actual size of any given table attribute instance at any given time may be smaller than the
OMCI single-message limit. Regardless of their actual size, however, the following treatment shall
be used to control the retrieval of all table attributes.
Figure I.1.5-1 shows the scenario diagram when the OLT gets a table attribute that is larger than the
OMCI message contents field (see clause 11.1.9 for limitations). The OLT asks the ONT for the
size of the attribute by sending a get command. In the get response, the ONT uses four bytes to
indicate the size of the data. This implies that the get response message is formatted as if the
oversized attribute had a size of four bytes. Then, the OLT will request the attribute data from the
ONT via the appropriate number of get next commands.
           Figure I.1.5-1 – Get an attribute that is larger than the OMCI message field
The OLT must issue as many "get next" requests as needed to accommodate the size of the data
indicated in the get response. The maximum time between two "get next" requests is 60 seconds. If
the OLT does not send a "get next" request within this time after the previous "get next" request or
after the get start request, the ONT assumes the get attribute command has been terminated and can
drop the copy of the attribute, and consider any get next requests to be out of range, as described in
clause II.2.44. In addition, the OLT should not initiate simultaneous multiple get next processes to
any one ONT, because capturing multiple snapshots of potentially large tables could exhaust the
limited memory resources of the ONT. Only if there is a special purpose for simultaneous get next
sequences should such an action be attempted.

I.1.7    Report test result
Figure I.1.7-1 shows the scenario diagram for when the OLT requests that the ONT perform a test.
The OLT requests that the ONT start testing by sending a "test" command. This command is
acknowledged by a "test" response. Then, the ONT carries out the test. After the test is complete,
the ONT reports the test result via a "test result" notification message. This scenario is used for the
"self test" attribute of ONT-G managed entity or circuit pack managed entity. Moreover, this
scenario may be useful for MLT tests or for additional tests that may be added in the future.
                                Figure I.1.7-1 – Reporting of test result
The ONT may also report a test result autonomously in cases where it performs routine background
tests. An autonomous test report may be identified by the fact that its transactions identifier is 0. An
autonomous test report normally occurs only when some measured value is out of tolerance, and
may therefore be reported in conjunction with an alarm.
I.1.8    Alarm reporting control
Alarm reporting control allows for the suppression of alarms from physical path termination points,
under the control of the management system. A complete description of ARC from a generic
viewpoint is given in [ITU-T M.3100]. The OMCI provides for ARC functions using two attributes
of the PPTP: ARC and ARC interval. These two attributes are described below.
ARC
This attribute allows the activation of alarm reporting control (ARC) for this PPTP. The attribute
works in concert with the ARC_interval attribute. A value of zero indicates disabled, while a value
of 1 indicates enabled. The default value is disabled. When the ARC attribute is set to disabled, the
PPTP is in the "ALM" state, as defined in [ITU-T M.3100]. Alarms are reported normally in the
ALM state. When the ARC attribute is set to enabled, the PPTP is in the "NALM-QI" state, as
defined in [ITU-T M.3100]. Alarms are suppressed in this state.
The PPTP moves from the ALM state to the NALM-QI state when the OLT changes the ARC
attribute to enabled. The PPTP moves from the NALM-QI state to the ALM state when either 1) the
PPTP is trouble-free and the ARC_interval timer expires, or 2) the ARC attribute is set to disabled
by the OLT. If the ARC_interval timer expires, the ONT sets the ARC attribute to disabled
autonomously, and sends an AVC to notify the OLT. Please refer to [ITU-T M.3100] for more
extensive discussion.
Note that the ARC_interval can assume normal timing values of 0 to 254 minutes. The value 0
implies that a PPTP in the NALM-QI state goes immediately to the ALM state upon detection of a
problem-free state. An ARC_interval value of 255 has the special meaning that the timer never
expires. The PPTP remains in the NALM-QI state until the OLT sets the ARC attribute to disabled.
This behaviour is equivalent to the "NALM" state, which is another generic behaviour of the ARC
function in [ITU-T M.3100].
Note that there is no support for the NALM-TI sub-function in the OMCI system. (R,W) (optional)
(1 byte)
ARC_interval
This attribute defines the interval to be used with the ARC function for this PPTP. The values 0
through 254 give the duration in minutes for the NALM-QI timer. The special value 255 means that
the timer never expires. The default value is zero. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Note that ARC suppresses the reporting of the alarms, and not the alarm conditions themselves.
Therefore, if an alarm condition develops during an ARC interval, then the ONT should maintain
the internal indication of the alarm, and if the OLT gets all the alarms, it should be reported.
I.1.9     Performance monitoring
This Recommendation defines a number of performance monitoring managed entities. They share a
number of characteristics, as described here. Possible exceptions to the generic behaviour are
defined in the specific managed entity affected.
PM managed entities are created and deleted by the OLT, and the managed entity ID attribute takes
the same value as the parent managed entity's ME ID, so that no explicit pointer is required.
Each PM managed entity contains a pointer to an instance of the threshold data 1/2 managed
entities, which allow for thresholding and threshold crossing alerts (TCAs). Not all PM attributes
need to be thresholded; thresholding is part of the definition of each PM managed entity. Even
when thresholding is defined on a managed entity, it is the option of the OLT whether to provision
it (see clause I.1.10 regarding optional pointers). If fewer than seven thresholded counters appear in
an ME's definition, the threshold data 2 ME is not needed.
The ONT performs no archival; archival is the function of the OLT or a management system.
Conceptually, the ONT has only two storage bins: a current accumulator and a history bin. At
15-minute intervals, they switch roles. History is discarded at age thirty minutes, when the previous
history bin is initialized into its role as the new current accumulator. The previous accumulator,
now in its role as the history bin, retains its totals for 15 minutes, so that the OLT can upload them
if desired.
against the ONT-G managed entity. This establishes a 15-minute tick boundary and starts
numbering the intervals from 0. The interval number is returned in the interval end time attribute,
which is a standard attribute of all PM managed entities.
The interval count is a single byte, which rolls over from 255 back to 0.
The synchronize time action is the only mechanism guaranteed to reset either the phase or the
interval number. For example, neither ONT re-boot nor MIB reset can be expected to have these
effects (the performance monitoring consequence of the latter events is undefined).
During the accumulation interval, the PM managed entity collects performance statistics in
accordance with its definition, and continuously compares the accumulated values with thresholds
that may exist. When an accumulated value becomes equal to the threshold, the ONT originates a
threshold crossing alert (TCA). At the end of the current 15-minute interval, the ONT issues a
second TCA, cancelling the first.
It should be noted that TCAs are reported in OMCI alarm messages. The MEs are arranged so that
there is no overlap between TCA codepoints and alarm codepoints, mainly due to the fact that MEs
typically declare either alarms or TCAs, but not both.
The get action on a PM managed entity returns the values of attributes in the history bin. An ONT
may also support an optional action, get current data. The effect of this action is to return the value
of attributes in the current accumulator.
Most PM attributes are counters. If a counter should fill up during the interval, it remains at its
maximum possible value, rather than rolling over. In a few special cases, such as traffic loss ratio,
the attribute acquires a value only at the close of a 15-minute interval. The value returned by a get
current data operation is undefined. If a threshold is defined on such an attribute, the TCA is
declared at the end of the 15-minute interval and then immediately cleared as the registers are
re-initialized.
I.1.10 Optional pointers
In many cases, populating a pointer attribute may be optional (the prime example being the
threshold data 1/2 id attribute). When this happens, it is useful to be able to specify a null pointer in
OMCI. Because the OLT defines the pointers and the MEs to which they point, if the OLT has the
intention to not populate the optional pointer, it can do so by filling in any value that does not
correspond to an ME that exists. The ONT can therefore determine that the pointer 'points to
nothing,' and is therefore null. By convention, however, both 0 and 0xFFFF are often reserved as
attribute values to designate a null pointer. OLT conventions may vary for historical reasons; the
ONT should recognize either value.
I.2       Common services
The common services consist of:
a)        start-up phase of ONT;
b)        on demand circuit pack provisioning;
c)        on demand circuit pack de-provisioning;
d)        plug-and-play circuit pack provisioning;
e)        plug-and-play circuit pack de-provisioning;
f)        software image download;
g)        software image changes.
All the listed services are explained by the use of scenario diagrams.
The start-up phase of an ONT, from the OMCI point of view, belongs to one of two cases:
a)        the ONT is "new" to the OLT; or
b)        the OLT already "saw" this ONT at this PON.
The details of start-up scenarios also vary for ONTs with different configuration options, e.g.:
a)        ONT with cardholders at both PON IF and UNI;
b)        ONT with integrated interfaces at both PON IF and UNI;
c)        ONT with cardholders at PON IF and integrated interfaces at UNI; and
d)        ONT with integrated interfaces at PON IF and cardholders at UNI.
Here the following scenarios will only show cases a) and b), from which the scenarios for cases c)
and d) can be deduced. Additional scenarios can be derived for the cases where an ONT contains
common equipment and/or protected equipment.
NOTE – The preferred solution is that cardholder and circuit managed entities should always be modelled,
regardless of whether or not the ONT has integrated interfaces. However, the port mapping package provides
another way to map heterogeneous ports to a single parent equipment.
Figure I.2.1-1 shows the start-up phase of a "new" ONT with Cardholders on both sides.
Figure I.2.1-2 shows the start-up phase of a "new" ONT with integrated interfaces on both sides.
Figure I.2.1-3 shows the start-up phase of an "old" ONT.
The behaviour of the ONT with respect to inserted circuit packs during the start-up phase is not
shown in the following figures. This behaviour is the subject of clause I.2.2.
Note that if attribute value changes do not arrive at the OLT, the OLT will not know the number of
cardholders or integrated ports that reside in the ONT. The OLT can request the information of the
newly created managed entity instances by a sequence of "get" requests. If a "get" request is issued
on a non-existing instance, the response message to the OLT will indicate the error – Unknown
managed entity instance.
In general, the AVCs shown in Figures I.2.1-1 and I.2.1-2 should be viewed as a partial method of
ONT discovery. The OLT cannot rely on the receipt of AVCs to learn all ONT information, because
not all managed entities or attributes issue AVCs, and because AVCs can be lost in transmission
without an error being detected. Therefore, the OLT should audit any ONT immediately after a
reset is completed.

I.2.2     Circuit pack provisioning/de-provisioning
The provisioning and de-provisioning of a circuit pack can be triggered in two ways:
a)        on demand by the OpS;
b)        plug-and-play, triggered by detection of the card insertion/removal.
However, this trigger of provisioning and de-provisioning is transparent to the ONT, i.e., the ONT
always responds to OLT provisioning and de-provisioning commands. The difference between
plug-and-play mode and on-demand mode would reside in the OLT. For the on-demand mode,
the OLT provisions (de-provisions) the presence of the circuit pack in the ONT when it has been
provisioned (de-provisioned) by the operator; for the plug-and-play mode, the OLT provisions the
slot to "plug-and-play" and further provisions (de-provisions) the presence of the circuit pack in
the ONT as soon as it has received a notification from the ONT that a circuit pack has been plugged
in (out).
I.2.3     On-demand circuit pack provisioning
NOTE – It is possible to provision a circuit pack while a circuit pack of the same or of a different type is
provisioned for the cardholder. In case a circuit pack of the same type is already provisioned, the provisioned
command will have no effect. In case a circuit pack of a different type is already provisioned, this circuit
pack will be automatically de-provisioned and only then the system will be configured according to the
newly given plug-in unit type. Figures I.2.3-1 to I.2.3-3 show the scenarios of provisioning a circuit pack.
The cases below show the use of the attributes "expected type" and "actual type" of the
corresponding physical path termination points.
Case 1
The subscriber cardholder or the ONT itself (the latter in case of integrated interfaces) only supports
a specific type of interface. Notice that in the former case, the attribute "type" of the circuit pack
managed entity will be equal to this type.
In this case, on creation of the physical path termination point managed entity instance, the
attributes "expected plug-in unit type" and "actual plug-in unit type" of the subscriber linecard
holder managed entity are both set equal to the specific interface type and the ONT sends attribute
value change notifications to the OLT with the values of these attributes. It will not be possible for
the OLT to change the value of the attribute "expected plug-in unit type" later on (i.e., any attempt
by the OLT to change the value of the attribute will be refused by the ONT).
Case 2
The cardholder or the ONT itself (the latter in case of integrated interfaces) supports interfaces of
different types.
In this case, on creation of the physical path termination point managed entity instance, the attribute
"expected plug-in unit type" is set to plug-and-play (0xFF) and the attribute "actual plug-in unit
type" is set to:
•        inapplicable or unknown if the interface does not support plug-and-play or if the
         plug-and-play fails (actually, the coding is 0xFF in both cases);
•        the sensed type if the interface supports autosensing and the autosensing was successful.
The ONT will send an attribute value change notification with the values of these attributes.
Later on, it will be possible for the OLT to change the value of attribute "expected plug-in unit
type" with the "set" action. The value of attribute "actual type" will be set equal to the value of

Not shown in Figure I.2.5-1 are the notifications of the ONT due to incorrectly inserted circuit
packs.
I.2.6    Plug-and-play circuit pack de-provisioning
When a circuit pack is removed from a cardholder, a notification is sent to the OLT. The OLT
de-provisions the cardholder upon receiving the notification (see Figure I.2.6-1).

I.2.7    Software image download
The download of a software image is based on a "segmented stop and wait" protocol; thus, the next
segment can only be transmitted to the ONT if the previous segment is positively acknowledged. A
software image segment (also named window) consists of one of more software image sections.
Each section is transmitted in one OMCC message.
The number of sections in a segment is negotiated before the actual download. First, the OLT
proposes a segment size (not greater than 256). The ONT can propose a smaller segment size in the
response. If the response indicates a smaller segment size, this is the size to be used in the
download. Thus, an image segment consists of N image sections, with N being equal to the segment
size. Only the last image section is acknowledged. If the ONT processed all sections of a segment
properly, the acknowledgement will be positive, after which the OLT will download the next
segment.
Note that the section numbering starts from 0 so that segments of precisely 8 kilobytes can be
downloaded.
If an error occurred with a section of a segment (e.g., CRC error or missed section), the last section
will be negatively acknowledged, which will result in an entire retransmission of the last segment.
When the last segment transferred is positively acknowledged, the OLT sends a CRC-32 to the
ONT in the software image end download command. The ONT calculates the CRC-32 and
compares it to the CRC received from the OLT. If they are equal, the image is considered valid.
Figure I.2.7-1 gives the scenario for the software download.

II.1     General remarks
II.1.1   Message type identifier
The message types are given in clause 11.1.4.
II.1.2   Entity class identifier
The entity class identifiers are given in clause 11.1.6.
II.1.3   Result and reason
Responses to commands can indicate the result of the command. A value of "null" will indicate that
the command was processed successfully. Non-null values will indicate the reason of the failure. If
the result was "failure", the rest of the message contents will be filled with all 0x00s. The definition
of each result and reason is as follows:
1)       Command processed successfully
         There are two functions for command processing: command interpretation and command
         execution. This result means that the received command, such as get/set/test/reboot, was
         properly interpreted by the ONT's command interpretation function without errors and that
         the interpreted command was successfully transferred to the ONT's command execution
         function.
2)       Command processing error
         This result means the command processing failed at the ONT due to some reason not
         described by item 3), 4), etc.
3)       Command not supported
         This result means that the message type indicated in byte 8 is not supported by the ONT.
4)       Parameter error
         This result means that the command message received by the ONT was errored.
5)       Unknown managed entity
         This result means that the managed entity class indicated in bytes 10 and 11 is not
         supported by the ONT.
6)       Unknown managed entity instance
         This result means that the managed entity instance indicated in bytes 12 and 13 does not
         exist in the ONT.
7)       Device busy
         This result means that the command could not be processed due to process-related
         congestion at the ONT.
8)       Attribute(s) failed or unknown
         This result means that an optional attribute is not supported by the ONT or that a
         mandatory/optional attribute could not be executed by the ONT, even if it is supported. In
         conjunction with this result, attribute masks are used to indicate which attributes failed or
         were unknown.
         • optional attribute mask coding, which indicates whether or not the optional attribute is
              supported;
         • attribute execution mask coding, which indicates whether or not the mandatory/optional
              attribute was executed.
              See set response and get response message layouts (clauses II.2.10 and II.2.12) for the
              placement of these masks.
              If one or more optional attributes are not supported by the ONT, the "optional attribute
              mask coding" for each unsupported optional attribute becomes 1 while the
              corresponding "attribute execution mask coding" remains 0.
              If one or more mandatory or optional attributes were not executed by the ONT, the
              "optional attribute mask coding" remains 0, while the "attribute execution mask
              coding" becomes 1 for each failed attribute.
9)       Instance exists
         This result means that the ONT already has a managed entity instance that corresponds to
         the one the OLT is attempting to create.
II.1.4   Get, get response, create response and set messages
For an attribute mask, a bit map is used in the get, get response, create response and set messages.
This bit map indicates which attributes are requested (get) or provided (get response and set). The
bit map is composed as follows:
                                                           Bit
  Byte
              8            7            6            5            4            3            2            1
    1    Attribute 1 Attribute 2  Attribute 3  Attribute 4   Attribute 5 Attribute 6  Attribute 7  Attribute 8
    2    Attribute 9 Attribute 10 Attribute 11 Attribute 12 Attribute 13 Attribute 14 Attribute 15 Attribute 16
The attribute numbers correspond to the ordering of the attributes in clause 9. Note that the
managed entity identifier, which is an attribute of each managed entity, has no corresponding bit in
the attribute mask. Thus, the attributes are counted starting from the first attribute after the managed
entity identifier.
II.1.5   Alarm notifications
The ONT will send this notification each time an alarm status has changed for the entity indicated
in the message identifier. The message shows the status of all alarms of this entity. It is up to the
OLT to determine which alarm status has changed.
The maximum number of alarms that is supported by the OMCI is 224 because of the available
message field of get all alarm next message. The bit map is composed as follows:
                                                           Bit
  Byte
               8            7            6            5            4           3            2            1
    1    Alarm 0      Alarm 1      Alarm 2     Alarm 3       Alarm 4     Alarm 5      Alarm 6      Alarm 7
    2    Alarm 8      Alarm 9      Alarm 10    Alarm 11      Alarm 12    Alarm 13     Alarm 14     Alarm 15
   …
   28    Alarm 216 Alarm 217 Alarm 218 Alarm 219 Alarm 220 Alarm 221 Alarm 222 Alarm 223
The alarm numbers correspond to the alarm coding in clause 9. Bits in the alarm bit map that
correspond to non-existing alarms shall always be set equal to 0. Bits that correspond to existing
alarms are set to a value of 0 to indicate that the corresponding alarm is cleared, or a value of 1 to
indicate that the alarm has been raised.
Alarm message sequence numbers can take values in the interval 1 to 255. Zero is excluded in order
to make this counter similar to the MIB data sync counter.
II.1.6   Test, test response and test result
The descriptions below indicate how test, test response and test result messages are related.
Test:              This message is used to initiate either a self test or any of the other specific tests
                   defined against various managed entity types.
Test response: This message is an immediate reaction to a test message. The test response message
                   reports the ability of the ONT to run the required test, but it does not contain any
                   specific results.
Test result:       This message is used to report the result of either a self test (requested by the OLT)
                   or one of the specific tests defined against various managed entity types. The test
                   result notification is not used for autonomous tests that produce only pass-fail
                   results. Instead, notification is sent to the OLT via an alarm if the managed entity
                   fails its autonomous self test. Autonomous tests on the ANI-G managed entity may,
                   however, be reported with an autonomous test result message, with or without
                   corresponding alarms, on grounds that the actual measured values may be
                   important.
A test on a particular managed entity instance is invoked by sending a test message to this instance.
Each managed entity that supports tests needs to have an action test defined for it. The type of test
invoked by a test message depends on the managed entity.
The test response message is an indication to the OLT that the test request is received and is being
processed. The results of a requested test are sent to the OLT via a specific test result message.
The test response message is sent immediately after the test message is received (i.e., within the
normal response time). The transaction identifier of the test response message is identical to the
transaction identifier of the test message that requested the test.

It should be noted that the message contents for the "create" message apply only to attributes that
are defined to be "set-by-create". Writeable attributes that are not set-by-create are not permitted in
a create message. Thus, the first byte of the message contents field begins with the attribute value
for the first set-by-create attribute and so forth. Space for each set-by-create attribute must be
allocated in the create message, even if the attribute is optional. When an optional attribute is not to
be instantiated, the placeholder value to be entered into this space is specific to the definition of
each attribute.

Bytes 42 to 45 are always reserved for the optional attribute and attribute execution masks;
however, the content of these bytes is only valid in conjunction with the 1001 encoding used to
indicate failed or unknown attributes.
When the ONT wishes to transfer an attribute whose size is or might be larger than the space
available in one OMCI message, the ONT responds with four bytes to indicate the size of that
attribute with an appropriate attribute mask. The OLT should then use the get next message in order
to retrieve the attribute.

The bit map used in the get all alarms next response for a given managed entity class is identical to
the bit map used in the alarm notifications for that managed entity class.
In the case where the ONT receives a get all alarms next request message in which the command
sequence number is out of range, the ONT should respond with a message in which bytes 14 to 45
are all set to 0. This corresponds to a response with entity class 0, entity instance 0, and bit map all
0s.

 NOTE – For table attributes, the AVC message will contain no attribute value (only a mask), and no
 snapshot of the table will be created. If the OLT wishes to obtain the new value, it will then do a get
 operation, followed by the required number of get next operations.
II.2.27 Test
The format of the test message is specific to the target entity class. At present, three formats are
defined. Future test extensions for a given entity class can be supported by adding additional
encodings to presently unused bits or bytes. Future specification of tests for other entity classes may
use an existing format or may define new formats for the test message. These extension
mechanisms allow future tests to be supported without changing the principle of operation.

This message supports two basic categories of test operation, a defined set of tests that look in and
out from the POTS port, and a set of codepoints that may be used for vendor-specific tests. The
latter category is further subdivided into codepoints that return test results in a general purpose
buffer ME, using the test results message primarily as an event trigger to signal test completion, and
codepoints that return all test results in an ordinary test result message. If it is needed, the OLT must
create the general purpose buffer managed entity before initiating the test action.
Note that a single message can be used to initiate multiple tests on a given ME if desired.
Bytes 15-28 are used by the dial tone make-break test. A zero value for a timer causes the ONT to
use its built-in defaults. As many as three dial tone frequencies can be specified, or omitted by
setting their values to 0. Other fields are also omitted with the value 0, or controlled by flags. An
ONT can support the dial tone test with internal defaults only, and is not required to support any of
the attributes of bytes 15-28. Likewise, an ONT can use internal defaults for drop test, rather than
the values given in bytes 29-38. The capabilities of an ONT are documented by the vendor and
known through administrative practices.

II.2.28 Test response
If an ONT does not support all tests requested in byte 14 of the test message, it should not execute
any test and should respond with result 0010, command not supported. If an ONT supports all of the
requested tests but cannot support one or more of the explicitly specified threshold attributes, it
should not execute any test and should respond with result 0011, parameter error. The test
command could then be re-issued with different thresholds or default thresholds, and would be
expected to succeed.

that suggested by the OLT in the original request), and 0 padding for the remaining bytes.
An ONT that supports the optional parallel download feature responds with the full format shown
below. If the ONT does not support the parallel download feature, it responds with the code
0b0101, unknown managed entity instance.

The response message informs the OLT whether the download command was successful. If a single
software image ME was targeted for download, byte 14 reports the result of the process. If a
number of software images were targeted for parallel download, byte 14 reports device busy as long
as any of the instances is busy writing the image to non-volatile store. Once the ONU has stored all
images successfully, it responds with a 0 in byte 14 and a separate result for each software image
ME.

II.2.45 Test result
The test result message is used to report the result of a test. In the case of a requested test, the
transaction identifier of the test result message is identical to the transaction identifier of the test
message that initiated the corresponding test. In the case of a self-triggered test result, the
transaction identifier is set to 0.
Several formats are currently defined. They are used as follows:
•        Self test results, ONT-G, circuit pack, or any other ME that supports self test.
•        Vendor-specific test results, generic format, any ME that supports it.
•        POTS (or BRI) test results, either MLT, dial tone draw-break or vendor-specific POTS tests
         that use a general purpose buffer.
•        ICMP tests, either ping or traceroute.
•        The results of an optical line supervision test on the ANI-G.
If a new test for the presently-supported entities is defined in the future, the corresponding test
results can be reported by extending the test result message layout. If a new test for other managed
entity classes is defined in the future, a new test result message layout may be defined.

 NOTE – Test result types are specified in clause 11.1.10. Type-value fields are packed in the lowest byte
 positions. Unused trailing byte positions are filled with 0 values. If more than 10 type-value pairs are to be
 returned, an additional test type should be defined in the test message. At the vendor's discretion, a test
 result may include an ordered sequence of repeated type-value pairs to represent, for example, port
 ordering, or first/second power input. In this case, missing values can be flagged with type = 255.
Format for POTS UNI and PPTP ISDN UNI entity classes
Byte 14 reports a summary MLT test result. The result for each test category is limited to the two
values "test passed or was not executed" or "test failed". Bytes 16 and 17 report the results of a dial
tone test.
Byte 15 reports the result of a self test or a vendor-specific test that returns results in a general
purpose buffer. At present, self test is not supported for the POTS UNI and PPTP ISDN UNI entity
classes, and this byte should be set to 0.
There are four possible outcomes for a given test: it can pass, fail, not be run, or not be recognized
by the ONT. If an ONT does not support or recognize a given test, it is expected to deny the test
request message. To avoid physical damage, an ONT may cease testing if a test – usually
potentially hazardous – fails, and thus some subsequent tests will not be run. In addition, the ONT
may support some but not all tests of a given suite, such as power measurements in the dial tone test
sequence. The category summary in byte 14 includes two values. The value 1 indicates either that
all tests in a category passed, or that nothing in the category was tested, while 0 indicates that at
least one test in the category failed. Further information appears in flags specific to each test results
attribute to indicate whether each detailed test was run or not, whether it passed or failed and
whether a measured result is reported or not.

                                 Traffic management options
                (This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation)
Depending on the trade-off between the complexity and the number of supported features, the ONT
can have various traffic management options. Examples of traffic management implementation in
the ONT are described in the following clauses. This appendix also indicates how the MIB defined
in clause 9 is used for each implementation.
It should be pointed out that the ONT traffic management is not limited to these examples. ONT
traffic management is likely a place where every vendor searches for a proprietary feature to give it
a competitive advantage. However, every proprietary feature requires some kind of management
that impacts the OMCI. In fact, it is difficult for the specification given in this Recommendation to
keep up with the technological and feature innovations. It is envisioned that vendor specific
managed entities will be needed to manage the traffic management related functions in the ONT.
III.1    Priority queue configuration
When the focus is on low complexity implementation, the ONT uses the priority controlled
upstream traffic method. In this case, the ONT has no traffic contract or QoS awareness. The ONT
is configured by the OLT with a priority for each connection for both directions.
Theoretically, UPC is needed at every multiplexing point, including the ONT. A system with the
UPC function has to monitor the traffic volume entering the network from all active connections to
ensure that the agreed parameters are not violated and to deploy a frame discard or tag policy. In the
priority queue implementation, the UPC function is moved to the OLT, where it protects the core
network. The PON is protected by the "UPC-like" MAC (via the DBA process). The MAC manages
all connections from an T-CONT as a whole. Essentially, the MAC isolates T-CONTs from each
other.
As such, CPEs sharing one T-CONT may have to regulate their own connection streams to maintain
quality. A CPE sending out more traffic on one connection will do so at the expense of the other
connections established at the same T-CONT.
III.2    Explicit traffic scheduler configuration
In slightly more complex implementations, ONTs may implement some level of traffic scheduling
within each T-CONT. These are described using priority queues and one or more levels of traffic
scheduler MEs. The arrangement of priority queues and traffic schedulers is determined by the
ONT, and is generally not controllable by the OLT. An example of the configuration of the traffic
scheduler can be as proposed in Figure III.2-1. This model consists of three stages, such as
two delay control and one guaranteed rate control stages. A delay control stage can be worked by
HOL (head of line) scheduling. A guaranteed rate control stage can be worked by WRR.

III.3   Traffic descriptor configuration
An alternative method of controlling traffic in ONTs is to provide traffic descriptors to the ONT,
and leave the details of honouring and enforcing these contracts to the ONT implementation. This is
controlled using the GEM traffic descriptor MEs. This method uses the theoretical assumption that
a work-conserving scheduling methodology will be used.

               (This appendix does not form an integral part of this Recommendation)
IV.1    Network overview
This Recommendation considers networks that use G-PON systems that include a video overlay.
This system provides a bidirectional GEM transport service and a unidirectional video or data
downstream broadcast or unicast service. If only broadcast video services are desired, then the only
video transport required is the third wavelength, as shown in Figure IV.1-1. The ONT converts the
signals on the third wavelength to electrical signals on a coaxial output, suitable for video
appliances such as televisions.

                       Figure IV.1-1 – A G-PON with broadcast video only
In many cases, however, interactive video services are needed. In this case, the customer's video
termination equipment (commonly referred to as a set-top box, or STB) needs connectivity back to
the video control equipment in the central office. In the case of the G-PON system, this connectivity
must be provided by the ONT and OLT. This scenario is depicted in Figure IV.1-2. The connection
begins in the STB, which transmits its information up the coaxial cables that connect it to the ONT.
The ONT must receive this information, and adapt it to be carried on the G-PON in the form of an
GEM connection. The OLT terminates the GEM connection, and recovers the VRP upstream
datagrams. These datagrams are then interworked at some level (possibly ATM cross-connection,
AAL5 interworking, or application-specific interworking). At some point, the resulting data
terminates on the video control equipment.
                     Figure IV.1-2 – A G-PON with interactive video services
Figure IV.1-2 defines two interfaces that are important to interoperability. The STB-ONT interface
is the first. This interface is defined by two standards: [SCTE 55-1] and [SCTE 55-2]. These are
peer standards that are mutually exclusive; that is, a system will run either one or the other, but not
both at one time. Furthermore, each of these standards defines several grades of capability, one
being chosen as the default (or basic practice). Clauses IV.2 and IV.4 clarify this interface for the
purposes of providing the video return path over G-PON.
The second important interface is the ONT-network interface. This logical interface is a GEM
connection that conducts the return path information back to the video equipment in the central
office. The information must be formatted in a standardized way so that common control equipment
can be used. The formatting depends on the particular return path interface being used. Clauses IV.3
and IV.5 define these formats.
Given the situation that there are two modes on both interfaces, it makes sense that the ONT has
two modes of operation, denoted mode 1 and mode 2. Mode 1 corresponds to support of the
SCTE 55-1 system, and mode 2 corresponds to support of the SCTE 55-2 systems. The mode is set
by the network operator during the initialization management of the video service.
IV.2     Mode 1 STB-ONT interface
The STB-ONT interface, in this case, is based on that from the commonly deployed [SCTE 55-1].
[SCTE 55-1] defines all the aspects of the interactive video control system, while the STB-ONT
interface herein described is only concerned with the upstream transmission of data. Therefore, we
specify below which clauses are relevant to the definition of the STB-ONT interface.
Relevant clauses of [SCTE 55-1] that apply to the STB-ONT interface:
         5.2      Physical layer for return-path transmission
         5.2.1 Return-path modem description – A general explanation, required.
         5.2.2 RF return path packet format – Specifies the format of the upstream packet,
                  required.
         Please note that the unique word specified in this clause is given in standard QPSK
         notation, and not differential QPSK notation.
         5.2.3 RF return-path forward error correction – Specifies the code used for the FEC
                  bytes, optional.
         Please note that while the FEC will be calculated by compliant STBs, the ONT's processing
         of the FEC is optional.
         5.2.4 RF return-path randomizer – Specifies the randomizer used in the upstream
                  packets, required.
         Please note that the randomizer output is applied to the entire packet EXCEPT the unique
         word. Also, the programmable value of the randomizer seed to be used is given in the video
         return path service profile managed entity.
         5.2.5    RF return path modulator – Specifies the physical layer to be used, required.
         Note that while the centre frequency is specified to a wider range, in actual practice this
         frequency is limited from 8 to 12 MHz. Also, the DQPSK mode to be used is given in the
         video return path service profile managed entity.
         5.2.6    RF return-path demodulator specification – Specifies the physical layer to be used,
                  required.
All other clauses of [SCTE 55-1] are not relevant to the STB-ONT interface. In particular, the
extended practice (clause 5.3) is explicitly not supported.
IV.3      Mode 1 ONT-network interface
In mode 1, the ONT must forward the derandomized packet sequence field (1 byte) and the ATM
data (53 bytes) intact to the video control system. The procedure to do this is:
1)        Receive the DQPSK burst, and capture all 62 bytes of data and measure the power level of
          the burst relative to the nominal input power level for the receiver.
2)       Exclusive OR the randomizer sequence with the received data.
3)       Calculate the FEC parity, compare with that received, and detect/correct errors. Discard
          cells that have uncorrectable errors (optional).
4)        Assemble the datagram to be forwarded, which is 56 bytes in length.
5)       Encapsulate the datagram using GEM.
6)        Forward the GEM fragment over a GEM port CTP allocated on the PON.
The structure of the incoming RF burst data and the outgoing GEM circuit data is shown in
Figure IV.3-1. The outgoing datagram is always 56 bytes in length, and is composed of a two-byte
level indication field, a one-byte packet sequence field, and a 53-byte ATM data field. The unique
word and FEC bytes are terminated in the ONT. The resulting GEM fragment is 61 bytes (488 bits).

       Figure IV.3-1– The transformation of a 55-1 formatted burst into a GEM fragment
The level indication field is formatted as: a1bb bbbb 0000 0000, where:
Bit a is a detection indicator to be used if FEC is implemented in the ONT (if not, bit a should be set
to zero), where:
          a = 0 means burst was detected without errors;
          a = 1 means a burst was detected with errors, but was corrected.
The 1 is a reserved bit.
Bits bbbbbb are a power indication, containing the 2s complement representation of the measured
power of this burst, in units of decibels relative to the nominal receive power of the equipment. For
example, if the nominal receive power of the ONT is 10 dBmV, and a burst arrives with 17 dBmV,
then bbbbbb = 000111. If the same ONT receives a 7 dBmV burst, then bbbbbb = 111101.
The "0000 0000" are all reserved bits.
The GEM port-ID that carries the video return path data can be configured to provide a non-assured
traffic service. The data rate of the service can be calculated from the latency requirements of the
55-1 protocol and equipment implementation. Practical implementations of this protocol have round
trip delay tolerances on the order of 100 ms. After this time, the STB will begin to re-transmit its
upstream bursts. One of the contributors of the delay will be the cell transmission time, which in our
case is the inverse of the data burst rate.
For example, if 20 ms is allocated for cell transmission time, then the cell rate for the video return
path connection should be made 488/20ms ~ 25 kbit/s.
To summarize, the ONT-network interface is 56-byte payloads (as defined above) encapsulated in
GEM, carried in a GEM port-ID.
IV.4     Mode 2 STB-ONT interface
The STB-ONT interface in this case is based on that from the commonly deployed [SCTE 55-2].
[SCTE 55-2] defines all the aspects of the interactive video control system, while the STB-ONT
interface herein described is only concerned with the upstream transmission of data. Therefore, we
specify below which clauses are relevant to the definition of the STB-ONT interface.
Relevant clauses of [SCTE 55-2] that apply to the STB-ONT interface:
         2.2      Upstream physical interface specification – A general explanation of the system,
                  required.
         2.2.1 Quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) – A description of the physical layer used,
                  required.
                  – Grade A 256 kbit/s is optional.
                  – Grade B 1.544 Mbit/s is required.
                  – Grade C 3.088 Mbit/s is optional.
         2.2.2 Coaxial cable impedance – A physical layer parameter, required.
         2.2.3 Time division multiple access (TDMA), optional.
         2.2.4 Contention-based access, required.
All other clauses of [SCTE 55-2] are not relevant to the STB-ONT interface.
IV.5     Mode 2 ONT-network interface
In mode 2, the ONT forwards the de-randomized ATM cells (53 bytes) to the video control system.
The procedure to do this is:
1)       Receive the QPSK burst, and capture all 59 bytes of data.
2)       Exclusive OR the randomizer sequence with the received data.
3)       Calculate the FEC parity, compare with that received, and detect/correct errors. Discard
         cells that have uncorrectable errors (required).
4)       Forward the ATM cells over a GEM port-ID allocated on the PON.
The structure of the incoming RF burst data and the outgoing GEM data is shown in Figure IV.5-1.
The outgoing datagram is a 53-byte ATM cell. The unique word and FEC bytes are terminated in
the ONT. The resulting GEM fragment is 58 bytes (464 bits).
