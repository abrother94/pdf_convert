9.8.7   Pseudowire maintenance profile
The pseudowire maintenance profile permits the configuration of pseudowire service exception
handling. It is created and deleted by the OLT.
The settings, and indeed existence, of a pseudowire maintenance profile affect the behaviour of the
pseudowire performance monitoring history data managed entity only in establishing criteria for
counting severely errored seconds, but in no other way. The pseudowire maintenance profile
primarily affects the alarms declared by the subscribing pseudowire termination point.
One or more instances of the pseudowire termination point may point to an instance of the
pseudowire maintenance profile. If the pseudowire termination point does not refer to a pseudowire
maintenance profile, the ONT's default exception handling is implied.
Attributes
Managed entity id:               This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                 entity. The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                                 (2 bytes)
Jitter buffer maximum            This attribute specifies the desired maximum depth of the playout
depth:                           buffer in the PSN to TDM direction. The value is expressed as a
                                 multiple of the 125 μs frame rate. The default value 0 selects the
                                 ONT's internal policy. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (2 bytes)
Jitter buffer desired depth:  This attribute specifies the desired nominal fill depth of the playout
                                 buffer in the PSN to TDM direction. The value is expressed as a
                                 multiple of the 125 μs frame rate. The default value 0 selects the
                                 ONT's internal policy. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (2 bytes)
Fill policy:                     This attribute defines the payload bit pattern to be applied toward the
                                 TDM service if no payload packet is available to play out. The
                                 default value 0 specifies that the ONT apply its internal policy.
                                 0          ONT default, vendor-specific (recommended:  AIS for
                                            unstructured service, all 1s for structured service).
                                 1          Play out AIS according to the service definition
                                            (for example, DS3 AIS).

                                 5          Play out DS1 idle (Appendix C of [b-ATIS T1.403]).
                                 6..15      Reserved for future standardization.
                                 16..255 Vendor-specific, not to be standardized.
                                 (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
Four pairs of alarm-related policy attributes, defined below, share common behaviour.
The alarm declaration policy attribute defines the anomaly rate that causes the corresponding alarm
to be declared. It is an integer percentage between 1..100. If this density of anomalies occurs during
the alarm onset soak interval, the alarm is declared. The default value 0 selects the ONT's internal
policy.
The alarm clear policy attribute defines the anomaly rate that causes the corresponding alarm to be
cleared. It is an integer percentage between 0..99. If no more than this density of anomalies occurs
during the alarm clear soak interval, the alarm is cleared. The default value 255 selects the ONT's
internal policy.

R-bit transmit set policy:    This attribute defines the number of consecutive lost packets that
                              causes the transmitted R-bit to be set in the TDM to PSN direction,
                              indicating lost packets to the far end. The default value 0 selects the
                              ONT's internal policy. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
R-bit transmit clear policy:  This attribute defines the number of consecutive valid packets that
                              causes the transmitted R-bit to be cleared in the TDM to PSN
                              direction, removing the remote failure indication to the far end. The
                              default value 0 selects the ONT's internal policy. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
R-bit receive policy:         This attribute defines the action toward the N x 64 TDM interface
                              when remote failure is indicated on packets received from the PSN
                              (either R-bit set or M = 0b10 while the L-bit is cleared).
                              0   Do nothing (default).
                              1   Play out service-specific RAI/REI/RDI code.
                              2   Send channel idle signalling and idle channel payload to all DS0s
                                  comprising the service.
                              (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
L-bit receive policy:         This attribute defines the action toward the TDM interface when far
                              end TDM failure is indicated on packets received from the PSN
                              (L-bit set).
                              0   Play out service-specific AIS (default).
                              1   Repeat last received packet.
                              2   Send channel idle signalling and idle channel payload to all DS0s
                                  comprising the service.
                              (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
SES threshold:                Number of lost, malformed or otherwise unusable packets expected
                              in the PSN to TDM direction within a one-second interval that causes
                              a severely errored second to be counted. Stray packets do not count
                              toward a severely errored second, nor do packets whose L-bit is set at
                              the far end. The default value is 3. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional)

This managed entity collects PM for a pseudowire termination point. Most of the attributes monitor
packets received from the PSN, and may therefore be considered egress PM. For the most part,
ingress PM is collected at the CES PPTP managed entity.
NOTE – The pseudowire performance monitoring history data managed entity collects data similar, but not
identical, to that available from the MAC bridge port PM history data ME associated with a MAC bridge.
When the pseudowire is bridge-based, it may not be necessary to collect both.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the pseudowire termination
point.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                  entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                  linked to an instance of the pseudowire termination point. (R,
                                  Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:                This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                                  (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:            This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2
                                  managed entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W,
                                  Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Received packets:                 This attribute counts the total number of packets, both payload and
                                  signalling, received in the PSN to TDM direction. (R) (mandatory)
                                  (4 bytes)
Transmitted packets:              This attribute counts the total number of packets, both payload and
                                  signalling, transmitted from the TDM to the PSN. The count includes
                                  packets whose L-bit is set and which may therefore contain no
                                  payload. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Missing packets:                  This attribute counts the number of lost packets, as indicated by gaps
                                  in the control word numbering sequence. Both payload and signalling
                                  packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Misordered packets, usable:  This attribute counts the number of packets received out of order, but
                                  which were able to be successfully re-ordered and played out. Both
                                  payload and signalling packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Misordered packets                This attribute counts the number of packets received out of sequence
dropped:                          that were discarded, either because the ONT did not support
                                  reordering or because it was too late to reorder them. Both payload
                                  and signalling packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Playout buffer                    This attribute counts the number of packets that were discarded
underruns/overruns:               because they arrived too late or too early to be played out. Both
                                  payload and signalling packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Malformed packets:             This attribute counts the number of malformed packets, for example
                               because the packet length was not as expected or because of
                               unexpected RTP payload type. Both payload and signalling packets,
                               if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Stray packets:                 This attribute counts the number of packets whose ECID or RTP
                               SSRC failed to match the expected value, or which are otherwise
                               known to have been misdelivered. Stray packets are discarded
                               without affecting any of the other PM counters. Both payload and
                               signalling packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory)
                               (4 bytes)
Remote packet loss:            This attribute counts received packets whose R-bit is set, indicating
                               the loss of packets at the far end. Both payload and signalling
                               packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
TDM L-bit packets              This attribute counts the number of packets transmitted with the L-bit
transmitted:                   set, indicating a near-end TDM fault. Both payload and signalling
                               packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
ES:                            This attribute counts errored seconds. Any discarded, lost, malformed
                               or unusable packet received from the PSN during a given second
                               causes this counter to increment. Both payload and signalling
                               packets, if any, contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
SES:                           This attribute counts severely errored seconds. The criterion for a
                               SES may be configured through the pseudowire maintenance profile
                               managed entity. Both payload and signalling packets, if any,
                               contribute to this count. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
UAS:                           This attribute counts unavailable seconds. An unavailable second
                               begins at the onset of ten consecutive SESs and ends at the onset of
                               ten consecutive seconds that are not severely errored. A service is
                               unavailable if either its payload or its signalling, if any, are
                               unavailable. During unavailable time, only UAS should be counted;
                               other anomalies should not be counted. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
