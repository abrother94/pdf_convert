9.9.9     VoIP feature access codes
The VoIP feature access codes managed entity defines administrable feature access codes for the
VoIP subscriber. It is optional for ONTs that support VoIP service. If a non-OMCI interface is used
to manage VoIP signalling, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI interface supplies the necessary
data, which may be read back to the OLT via the SIP config portal ME.
Instances of the managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT. A VoIP feature access codes
managed object is needed for each unique set of feature access code attributes.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with one or more SIP user data managed
entities.
