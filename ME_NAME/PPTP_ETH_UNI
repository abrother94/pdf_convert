9.5.1   Physical path termination point Ethernet UNI
This managed entity represents the point at an Ethernet UNI where the physical path terminates and
Ethernet physical level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•       When the ONT has Ethernet ports built into its factory configuration.
•       When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of Ethernet type.
•       When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of
        Ethernet type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence
        of Ethernet ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to
        instantiate a port mapping package that specifies Ethernet ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an Ethernet circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an Ethernet circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a preprovisioned or real
Ethernet port.
Attributes
Managed entity id:               This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                                 This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the UNI. The
                                 first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte is the
                                 port ID, with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Expected type:                   This attribute supports pre-provisioning. It is coded as follows:
                                 0            Autosense.
                                 1 to 254     One of the values from Table 9.1.5-1 that is compatible with
                                              an Ethernet circuit pack.
                                 Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                                 (mandatory) (1 byte)
Sensed type:              When a circuit pack is present, this attribute represents its type as one of
                          the values from Table 9.1.5-1. If the value of expected type is not 0, then
                          the value of sensed type should be the same as the value of expected
                          type. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. See also
                          the note in the notifications below.
                          (R) (mandatory if the ONT supports circuit packs with configurable
                          interface types, e.g., 10/100 BaseT card) (1 byte)
Auto detection            This attribute sets the Ethernet port configuration:
configuration:
                    Codepoint               Rate                     Duplex

                          Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                          (mandatory for interfaces with auto detection options) (1 byte)
Ethernet loopback         This attribute sets the Ethernet loopback configuration:
configuration:            0           No loopback.
                          3           Loop 3, loopback of downstream traffic after PHY
                                      transceiver. Loop 3 is depicted in Figure 9.5.1-5.
Note that normal bridge behaviour may defeat the loopback signal, unless broadcast MAC
addresses are used. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W) (mandatory)
(1 byte)

Administrative state:  This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
                      managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                      functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this
                      managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer
                      generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the
                      scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:    This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable of
                      performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1).
                      (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Configuration ind:    This attribute indicates the configuration status of the Ethernet UNI.
                      0x01     10BaseT full duplex.
                      0x02     100BaseT full duplex.
                      0x03     Gigabit Ethernet full duplex.
                      0x11     10BaseT half duplex.
                      0x12     100BaseT half duplex.
                      0x13     Gigabit Ethernet half duplex.
                      The value 0 indicates that the configuration status is unknown (e.g.,
                      Ethernet link is not established or the circuit pack is not yet installed).
                      Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R) (mandatory)
                      (1 byte)
Max frame size:       This attribute denotes the maximum frame size allowed across this
                      interface. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets the attribute to 1518.
                      (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
DTE or DCE ind:       This attribute specifies the Ethernet interface wiring:
                      0     DCE (default).
                      1    DTE.
                      (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Pause time:           This attribute allows the PPTP to ask the subscriber terminal to
                      temporarily suspend sending data. Units are in pause quanta (1 pause
                      quantum is 512 bit times of the particular implementation). Values:
                      0..0xFFFF. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0.
                      (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
Bridged or IP ind:    This attribute specifies whether the Ethernet interface is bridged or
                      derived from an IP router function
                      0     Bridged.
                      1     IP router.
                      2 Depends on the parent circuit pack. 2 means that the circuit pack's
                            bridged or IP ind attribute is either 0 or 1.
                      Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 2. (R, W)
                      (optional) (1 byte)
ARC:                  See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:         See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
PPPoE filter:         This attribute controls filtering of PPPoE packets on this Ethernet port.
                      The value 0 allows packets of all types. The value 1 discards everything
                      but PPPoE packets. The default value is 0. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
                                 equipment over the Ethernet PPTP. The value 1 enables power over the
                                 Ethernet port. The default value 0 disables power feed. (R, W) (optional)
                                 (1 byte)

 NOTE – These values violate the rules of the AVC message, which require the changed value of the sensed
 type (in this case) attribute to be reported. Because of existing implementations, pre-existing documentation
 is retained; however, implementers should regard this attribute and its AVC with caution.
