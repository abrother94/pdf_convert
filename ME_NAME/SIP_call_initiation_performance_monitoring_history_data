9.9.15 SIP call initiation performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data related to call initiations of a VoIP SIP
agent. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the SIP agent config data or SIP
config portal ME.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                           instance of SIP agent config data. If a non-OMCI configuration method
                           is used for VoIP, the managed entity id is 0. (R, Set-by-create)
                           (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:           This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                             (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:       This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed entity
                             that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value attribute
                             number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                             Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Failed to connect            This attribute counts the number of times the SIP UA failed to
counter:                     reach/connect its TCP/UDP peer during SIP call initiations. (R)
                             (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Failed to validate           This attribute counts the number of times the SIP UA failed to validate
counter:                     its peer during SIP call initiations. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Timeout counter:             This attribute counts the number of times the SIP UA timed out during
                             SIP call initiations. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Failure received counter:This attribute counts the number of times the SIP UA received a failure
                             error code during SIP call initiations. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Failed to authenticate       This attribute counts the number of times the SIP UA failed to
counter:                     authenticate itself during SIP call initiations. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)

 data 1 managed entity.
