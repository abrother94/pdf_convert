9.1.7      ONT power shedding
This managed entity models the ONT's ability to shed services when the ONT goes into battery
operation mode after AC power failure. Shedding classes are defined, which may span multiple
circuit pack types. This feature works in conjunction with the power shed override attribute of the
circuit pack managed entity, which can selectively prevent power shedding of priority ports.
An ONT that supports power shedding automatically creates an instance of this managed entity.
Table 9.1.5-1. In the case of hybrid LIM types, multiple shedding classes may affect a circuit pack
if the hardware is capable of partial power shedding.
An ONT may choose to model its ports with the port mapping package-G of clause 9.1.8, rather
than with real or virtual circuit packs. In this case, power shedding pertains to individual PPTPs, as
listed in the second column of the table.

                        For each class of service, an interval attribute is defined below. The value 0
                        disables power shedding, while the value 1 enables immediate power shed,
                        that is, as soon as AC power fails. Other values specify the time, in seconds,
                        to keep the service active after AC failure before shutting them down and
                        shedding power. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets each of the interval
                        attributes to 0.
