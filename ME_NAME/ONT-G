9.1.1     ONT-G
This managed entity represents the ONT as equipment. The ONT automatically creates an instance
of this managed entity. It assigns values to read-only attributes according to data within the ONT
itself.
Relationships
All other managed entities in this Recommendation are related directly or indirectly to the ONT-G
entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:      This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                        There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Vendor id:              This attribute identifies the vendor of the ONT. It is the same as the four
                        most significant bytes of the ONT serial number as specified in
                        [ITU-T G.984.3]. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Version:                This attribute identifies the version of the ONT as defined by the vendor.
                        The character value "0" indicates that version information is not available
                        or applicable. (R) (mandatory) (14 bytes)
Serial number:          The serial number is unique for each ONT. It is defined in
                        [ITU-T G.984.3] and contains the vendor ID and version number. The first
                        four bytes are an ASCII-encoded vendor ID four letter mnemonic. The
                        second four bytes are a binary encoded serial number, under the control of
                        the ONT vendor. (R) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
management             implemented in the ONT. There are two options:
option:                0     Priority controlled and flexibly scheduled upstream traffic. The traffic
                             scheduler and priority queue mechanism are used for upstream traffic.
                       1     Rate controlled upstream traffic. The maximum upstream traffic of
                             each individual connection is guaranteed.
                       For clarification, see Appendix III.
                       Downstream priority queues are managed via the GEM port network
                       CTP ME.
                       Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to the value that
                       describes its implementation. The OLT must adapt its model to conform to
                       the ONT's selection. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
VP/VC                  This attribute is not used. If it is present, it should be set to 0. (R)
cross-connection       (optional) (1 byte)
function option:
Battery backup:        This Boolean attribute specifies whether the ONT/NT supports backup
                       battery monitoring. False disables battery alarm monitoring; true enables
                       battery alarm monitoring. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Administrative         This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
state:                 managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                       functions are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this managed
                       entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer generated.
                       Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the scope of this
                       Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:     This attribute reports whether the managed entity is currently capable of
                       performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1). (R)
                       (optional) (1 byte)
Actions
Get, set
Reboot:                Reboot the ONT.
Test:                  Test the ONT. The test action can be used either to perform equipment
                       diagnostics or to measure parameters such as received optical power, video
                       output level, battery voltage, etc. Extensions to the test and test response
                       messages are defined for these purposes; refer to Appendix II.
Synchronize time:      This action synchronizes the start time of all performance monitoring
                       managed entities of the ONT with the reference time of the OLT. All
                       counters of all monitoring managed entities are cleared to 0 and restarted.
                       Also, the value of the interval end time attribute of the monitoring managed
                       entities is set to 0 and restarted. See clause I.1.9 for further discussion
                       of PM.
Notifications
Test result:           Test results are reported via a test result message if the test is invoked by a
                       test command from the OLT.
