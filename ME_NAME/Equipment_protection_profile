9.1.11 Equipment protection profile
This managed entity supports equipment protection. There can be as many as two protection slots
protecting as many as eight working slots. Each of the working and protect cardholder managed
entities should refer to the equipment protection profile that defines its protection group. Instances
of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
An ONT should deny pre-provisioning that would create impossible protection groupings because
of slot or equipment incompatibilities. In the same way, the ONT should deny creation or addition
to protection groups that cannot be supported by the current equipage. Even so, an inconsistent card
type alarm is defined, for example to cover the case of a plug-and-play circuit pack installed in a
protection group cardholder that cannot support it.
Relationships
An instance of this object points to the working and protect cardholders, which in turn point back to
this managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                         first byte is 0. The second byte is assigned by the OLT, and must be unique
                         and non-zero. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Protect slot 1,          This pair of attributes describes the protecting cardholder entities in an
protect slot 2:          equipment protection group. There can be one or two protecting entities.
                         0        Undefined entry (default), a place-holder if there are fewer than two
                                  protecting entities in the protection group.
                         1..254 Slot number of the protecting circuit pack.
                         (R, W, Set-by-create) (at least one entry mandatory) (1 byte * 2 attributes)
working slot 1,          This group of attributes describes the working cardholder entities in an
working slot 2,          equipment protection group. There can be up to eight working entities.
working slot 3,          0        Undefined entry (default), a place-holder if there are fewer than
working slot 4,                   eight working entities in the protection group.
working slot 5,          1..254 Slot number of the working circuit pack.

Protect status 1,        This pair of attributes indicates whether each protection cardholder is
protect status 2:        currently protecting some other cardholder and, if so, which one.
                         0        Not protecting any other cardholder.
                         1..254 Slot number of the working cardholder currently being protected by
                                  this ME.
                         (R) (mandatory) (1 byte * 2 attributes)
Revertive ind:           This attribute specifies whether equipment protection is revertive. The
                         default value 0 indicates revertive switching; any other value indicates
                         non-revertive switching. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)
                          equipment must be free of error before a revertive switch occurs. It defaults
                          to 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (1 byte)

  Number                Alarm                                          Description
       0       Inconsistent card type     The expected or actual circuit pack type in a slot is incapable of
                                          participating in the equipment protection group, either because it
                                          is not subject to equipment protection or because its type or
                                          equipment ID differs from that previously defined for the other
                                          cardholders of the group. When possible, the ONT should deny
                                          provisioning attempts that would create incompatibilities but, for
                                          example, in the case of plug-and-play, it may not be possible to
                                          forestall the inconsistency.
