9.4.11 ARP configuration data
This managed entity organizes data associated with the ARP function related to an IP router. The
ONT automatically creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity upon creation or deletion of
an associated ARP service profile.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the ARP service profile.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                            instance of the ARP service profile. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ARP table max size:         This attribute defines the maximum number of ARP entries that can be
                            stored in the ARP table. Its value is determined by the ONT
                            implementation. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ARP table:                  This attribute lists the current entries in the ARP cache. An ARP cache
                            entry contains several fields:
                            port:                  The port number of the IP port associated with the
                                                   entry. (1 byte)
                            IP address:            An IP address. (4 bytes)
                            MAC address:           An equivalent MAC address resolved by the ARP
                                                   procedure. (6 bytes)
                            type:                  The entry type such as dynamic (3) or static (4).
                                                   (1 byte)
                            (R) (mandatory) (12N bytes, where N is the number of entries)
