9.3.5   MAC bridge port designation data
This managed entity records data associated with a bridge port. The ONT automatically creates or
deletes an instance of this managed entity upon the creation or deletion of a MAC bridge port
configuration data ME.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with one MAC bridge port configuration data ME.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                            instance of the MAC bridge port configuration data. (R) (mandatory)
                            (2 bytes)
cost port:                  bridge and designated port, which are some of the outputs of the read
                            port parameters operation defined in clause 14.8.2.1 of
                            [IEEE 802.1D]:
                            •         Identifier of the designated bridge for the port's segment
                                      (8 bytes).
                            •         Bridge identifier of the root transmitted by the designated
                                      bridge for the segment (8 bytes).
                            •         Port number of the designated port on the designated bridge
                                      considered to be part of this port's segment (4 bytes).
                            •         Path cost contribution of the designated port to this port's
                                      segment (4 bytes).
                            Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R)
                            (mandatory) (24 bytes)
Port state:                 This attribute provides status information on the port. Valid values
                            include:
                            0         Disabled.
                            1         Listening.
                            2         Learning.
                            3         Forwarding.
                            4         Blocking.
                            5         Linkdown.
                            6         Stp_off.
                            in accordance with [IEEE 802.1D]. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                            NOTE – The value linkdown is introduced to denote the port status when the
                            Ethernet link state is down. This value distinguishes the case where Ethernet
                            is physically down from the case where Ethernet is administratively down,
                            the latter being denoted by disabled.
                            The value stp_off is introduced to denote the port status where spanning tree
                            protocol is disabled by setting the port spanning tree ind attribute of the MAC
                            bridge port configuration data to false, and the Ethernet link state is up. This
                            value distinguishes whether or not frame forwarding is under control of STP.
