9.4.9    ICMP performance monitoring history data 2
This managed entity contains performance monitoring related to transmitted ICMP messages at an
IP router. An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the IP router service profile.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                         instance of the IP router service profile. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                         (2 bytes)
Interval end time:       This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval. (R)
                         (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:   This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2 managed
                         entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                         (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Icmp out msgs counter:  This attribute counts ICMP messages that this router attempted to send. It
                         includes those also counted by icmp out errors counter. (R) (mandatory)
                         (4 bytes)
Icmp out errors counter:  This attribute counts ICMP messages that this router did not send due to
                         problems within ICMP, such as a lack of buffers. This value should not
                         include errors outside the ICMP layer such as the inability of IP to route
                         the resultant packet. In some implementations, there may be no types of
                         error that contribute to this counter. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out dest unreachs   This attribute counts transmitted ICMP destination unreachable messages.
counter:                 (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out time excds      This attribute counts transmitted ICMP time exceeded messages. (R)
counter:                 (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out parm probs      This attribute counts transmitted ICMP parameter problem messages. (R)
counter:                 (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out src quenchs     This attribute counts transmitted ICMP source quench messages. (R)
counter:                 (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out redirects       This attribute counts transmitted ICMP redirect messages. (R)
counter:                 (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out echos counter:  This attribute counts transmitted ICMP echo (request) messages. (R)
                         (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out echo reps       This attribute counts transmitted ICMP echo reply messages. (R)
counter:                 (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out timestamps      This attribute counts transmitted ICMP timestamp (request) messages.
counter:                 (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out timestamp reps This attribute counts transmitted ICMP timestamp reply messages. (R)
counter:                 (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out addr masks      This attribute counts transmitted ICMP address mask (request) messages.
counter:                 (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp out addr mask reps This attribute counts transmitted ICMP address mask reply messages. (R)
counter:                 (mandatory) (4 bytes)
