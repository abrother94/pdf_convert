9.7.23 xDSL xTU-C channel performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data of an xTU-C to xTU-R channel as seen
from the xTU-C. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with each xDSL bearer channel.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                               entity. The two most significant bits of the first byte are the bearer
                               channel ID. Excluding the first two bits of the first byte, the
                               remaining part of the managed entity ID is identical to that of this
                               ME's parent physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
                               (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:             This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                               (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:         This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                               entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                               attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                               Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Corrected blocks:              This attribute counts blocks received with errors that were corrected
                               on this channel. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Uncorrected blocks:            This attribute counts blocks received with uncorrectable errors on
                               this channel. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Transmitted blocks:            This attribute counts encoded blocks transmitted on this channel. (R)
                               (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Received blocks:               This attribute counts encoded blocks received on this channel. (R)
                               (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Code violations:               This attribute counts CRC-8 anomalies in the bearer channel. (R)
                               (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Forward error corrections:  This attribute counts FEC anomalies in the bearer channel. (R)
                               (mandatory) (2 bytes)
