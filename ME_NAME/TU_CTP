9.8.10 TU CTP
This managed entity organizes data that describes the TU path adaptation processing functions of
the ONT for SDH services. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted at the request of
the OLT.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity may be associated with an instance of a physical path
termination point CES UNI that supports SDH.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute provides a unique number for each instance of this
                              managed entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
TU type:                      This attribute identifies the TU type. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                              (1 byte)
                              1    TU-11.
                              2    TU-12.
                              3    TU-2.
                              4    TU-3.
GEM frame loss integration This attribute specifies the GEM frame loss integration period in
period:                       milliseconds. If GEM frame loss persists for this period, the
                              associated GEM interworking termination point generates a GEM
                              frame starvation alarm. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Transmit J1/J2:               This attribute is the path trace byte string that the ONT transmits
                              upstream. Its default value is null. If set, the ONT inserts a byte of
                              this attribute into the J1 or J2 into each TU payload frame. See
                              [ITU-T G.707] for further information. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (16 bytes)
Expected J1/J2:               This attribute is the path trace byte string that the ONT expects to
                              receive in the downstream direction. Its default value is null. If set,
                              the ONT compares the J1 or J2 in each received TU payload with this
                              attribute. If the received J1/J2 string differs, a TIM alarm is
                              generated. See [ITU-T G.707] for further information. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (16 bytes)
Received J1/J2:               This attribute is the actual path trace byte string that the ONT
                              received in the downstream direction. See [ITU-T G.707] for further
                              information. (R) (mandatory) (16 bytes)
TIM monitor admin:            This attribute specifies whether or not the TIM (trace indicator
                              mismatch) alarm is monitored. The following code points are
                              defined:
                              0    Enable.
                              1    Disable.
                              Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the scope of
                              this Recommendation, as it is normally handled through
                              supplier-operator negotiations. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)

 NOTE – When the received frame BER of VCn becomes ≥10−x, the VCn-SD, VCn-SF state is entered.
 The threshold X of VCn-SD and VCn-SF reuses the SD, SF threshold of the GEM frame.
