9.9.8   VoIP application service profile
The VoIP application service profile defines attributes of calling features used in conjunction with a
VoIP line service. It is optional for ONTs that support VoIP service. If a non-OMCI interface is
used to manage SIP for VoIP, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI interface supplies the
necessary data, which may be read back to the OLT via the SIP config portal ME.
An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT. A VoIP application service
managed object is needed for each unique set of profile attributes.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with zero or more SIP user data MEs.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
