9.1.5     Cardholder
The cardholder represents the fixed equipment slot configuration of the ONT. One or more of these
entities is contained in the ONT. Each cardholder can contain 0 or 1 circuit packs; the circuit pack
models equipment information that can change over the lifetime of the ONT, e.g., through
replacement.
An instance of this managed entity exists for each physical slot in an ONT that has pluggable circuit
packs. One or more instances of this managed entity may also exist in an integrated ONT, to
represent virtual slots. Instances of this managed entity are created automatically by the ONT, and
the status attributes are populated according to data within the ONT itself.
There is potential for conflict in the semantics of the expected plug-in unit type, the expected port
count and the expected equipment id, both when the slot is not populated and when a new circuit
pack is inserted. The expected plug-in unit type and the plug-in type mismatch alarm are
mandatory, although plug-and-play/unknown (circuit pack type 255) may be used as a way to
minimize their significance. It is recommended that an ONT deny the provisioning of inconsistent
combinations of expected equipment attributes.
When a circuit pack is plugged into a cardholder, or when a cardholder is preprovisioned to expect a
circuit pack of a given type, it may trigger the ONT to instantiate a number of managed entities and
update the values of others, depending on the circuit pack type. The ONT may also delete a variety
of other managed entities when a circuit pack is reprovisioned to expect no circuit pack or a circuit
pack of a different type. These actions are described in the definitions of the various managed
entities.
Expected equipment id and expected port count are alternate ways to trigger the same
preprovisioning effects. These tools may be useful if an ONT is prepared to accept more than one
circuit pack of a given type but with different port counts, or if a circuit pack is a hybrid that
matches none of the types in Table 9.1.5-1, but whose identification (e.g., part number) is known.
Relationships
An ONT may contain one or more instances of the cardholder, each of which may contain an
instance of the circuit pack managed entity. The slot id, real or virtual, is a fundamental
identification mechanism for managed entities with some relationship to physical location.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                          ONT sets the first byte of this two-byte identifier to:
                          0        if the ONT contains pluggable equipment modules;
                          1        if the ONT is a single integrated equipment.
                          The second byte of this identifier is the slot number. In integrated ONTs,
                          this byte may be used as a virtual slot or set to 0 to indicate a universal
                          pseudo-slot.
                          Slot numbering schemes differ among vendors. It is only required that slot
                          numbers be unique across the ONT. Up to 254 equipment slots are
                          supported in the range 1..254 (Note 1). The value 0 is reserved to indicate a
                          universal pseudo-slot. The value 255 is also reserved. (R) (mandatory)
                          (2 bytes)
                          NOTE 1 – Some xDSL managed entities use the two most significant bits of the
                          slot number for other purposes. An ONT that supports these services may have slot
                          limitations or restrictions.
Actual plug-in unit   This attribute is equal to the type of the circuit pack in the cardholder or 0 if
type:                 the cardholder is empty. This attribute is then redundant with the type
                      attribute of the circuit pack managed entity. Circuit pack types are defined
                      in Table 9.1.5-1. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                      The three following attributes permit the OLT to specify its intentions for
                      future equipage of a slot. Once some or all of these are set, the ONT can
                      proceed to instantiate circuit pack and PPTP MEs, along with other
                      predeterminable MEs, and allow the OLT to create related discretionary
                      MEs, thereby supporting service preprovisioning.
Expected plug-in unit  This attribute provisions the type of circuit pack for the slot. For type
type:                 coding, see Table 9.1.5-1. The value 0 means that the cardholder is not
                      provisioned to contain a circuit pack. The value 255 means that the
                      cardholder is configured for plug-and-play. Upon ME instantiation, the
                      ONT sets this attribute to 0. For integrated interfaces, this attribute may be
                      used to represent the type of interface. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Expected port count:  This attribute permits the OLT to specify the number of ports it expects in a
                      circuit pack. Prior to provisioning by the OLT, the ONT initializes this
                      attribute to 0. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Expected equipment    This attribute provisions the specific type of expected circuit pack. This
id:                   attribute applies only to ONTs that do not have integrated interfaces. In
                      North America, this may be the expected equipment CLEI code. Upon ME
                      instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to all spaces. (R, W) (optional)
                      (20 bytes)
Actual equipment id:  This attribute identifies the specific type of circuit pack, once it is installed.
                      This attribute applies only to ONTs that do not have integrated interfaces. In
                      North America, this may be the equipment CLEI code. When the slot is
                      empty or the equipment ID is not known, this attribute should be set to all
                      spaces. (R) (optional) (20 bytes)
Protection profile    This attribute indicates an equipment protection profile that may be
pointer:              associated with the cardholder. Its value is the least significant byte of the
                      managed entity ID of the equipment protection profile with which it is
                      associated, or 0 if equipment protection is not used. (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Invoke protection     The OLT may use this attribute to control equipment protection switching.
switch:               Code points have the following meaning when set by the OLT:
                      0        Release protection switch.
                      1        Operate protection switch, protect cardholder unspecified.
                      2        Operate protection switch, use first protect cardholder.
                      3        Operate protection switch, use second protect cardholder.
                      The ONT should deny attempts to switch to an unequipped, defective or
                      already active protection cardholder.
                      Upon the get action from the OLT, this attribute should return the current
                      value of the actual protection configuration. Code points are as defined
                      above, except that the value 1 is never returned.
                      When circuit packs that support a PON IF function are switched, the
                      response should be returned on the same PON that received the command.
                      However, the OLT should also be prepared to accept a response on the
                      redundant PON. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)

                                          This is a redundant alarm that helps the OLT distinguish
