9.2.4     GEM interworking termination point
An instance of this managed entity represents a point in the ONT where the interworking of a
service (e.g., CES, IP) or underlying physical infrastructure (e.g., n x DS0, DS1, DS3, E3, Ethernet)
to GEM layer takes place. At this point, GEM packets are generated from a bit stream
(e.g., Ethernet) or a bit stream is reconstructed from GEM packets.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity exists for each transformation of a data stream into GEM
packets and vice versa.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. It
                            must be unique over all interworking VCC termination point and GEM

termination point        service without a MAC bridge. Depending on the service provided, it
pointer:                 points to the associated instance of the following managed entities:
                         •        Physical path termination point CES UNI.
                         •        Logical N × 64 kbit/s sub-port connection termination point.
                         •        Physical path termination point Ethernet UNI.

                         In all other GEM services, the relationship between the related service
                         termination point and this GEM interworking termination point is derived
                         from other managed entity relations; this attribute is set to 0 and not used.
