9.4.4    IP route table
This managed entity records data associated with IP routes. The ONT automatically creates or
deletes an instance of this managed entity upon creation or deletion of an IP router service profile.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the IP router service profile.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                            instance of the IP router service profile. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Ip route number:            This attribute indicates the number of current routes in the route table. Its
                            initial value is 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Ip route table max size:  This attribute indicates the maximum number of routes that can be stored
                            in the route table. Its value is determined by the ONT implementation. (R)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Ip route table:             This attribute lists current routes in the route table. An entry contains the
                            following fields:
                            route id:              A unique identifier of a route within the route table.
                                                   (2 bytes)
                            destination            The IP destination address of this route. (4 bytes)
                            address:
                            destination            The address mask associated with the destination
                            address mask:          address. (4 bytes)
                            tos:                   TOS value defined in [IETF RFC 2096]
                                                   (ipCidrRouteTos) for use with policy routing;
                                                   otherwise 0. (1 byte)
                            next hop:              The address of the next router on remote routes.
                                                   (4 bytes)
                            output port:           The number of the IP port through which the next hop
                                                   of this route should be reached. (1 byte)
                            route type:            The type of route as defined in [IETF RFC 2096]
                                                   (ipCidrRouteType). (1 byte)
                            route protocol:        The routing mechanism via which this route was
                                                   learned,     as    defined     in     [IETF RFC 2096]
                                                   (ipCidrRouteProto). For example, static route is 3.
                                                   (1 byte)
                                                updated or otherwise determined to be correct. Static
                                                routes may return the value 0xFFFF FFFF. (4 bytes)
                          metric:               The primary (first 4 bytes) and secondary (second
                                                4 bytes) routing metrics for this route. The semantics
                                                of this metric are determined by the routing protocol
                                                specified in the route's route-protocol value. If part of
                                                this metric is not used, its value should be set to
                                                0xFFFF FFFF. (2* 4 bytes)
                          (R) (mandatory) (30N bytes, where N is the number of routes)
