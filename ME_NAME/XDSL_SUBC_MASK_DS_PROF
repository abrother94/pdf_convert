9.7.8   xDSL subcarrier masking downstream profile
This managed entity contains the subcarrier masking downstream profile for an xDSL line.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                           The four following attributes are bit maps that represent downstream
                           mask values for subcarriers 1..128 (mask 1) through 385..512 (mask 4).
                           The MSB of the first byte corresponds to the lowest numbered
                           subcarrier, and the LSB of the last byte corresponds to the highest. Each
                           bit position defines whether the corresponding downstream subcarrier is
                           masked (1) or not masked (default value 0).
                           NSCds is the highest numbered subcarrier that can be transmitted in the
                           downstream direction. For [ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.4], and
                           [ITU-T G.992.5], it is defined in the corresponding Recommendation.
                           For [ITU-T G.992.1], NSCds = 256 and for [b-ITU-T G.992.2],
                           NSCds = 128.
                           Downstream subcarrier (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (16 bytes)
mask 1:
                           Downstream subcarrier Subcarriers 129 to 256. (R, W) (mandatory for modems that support
mask 2:                    NSCds > 128) (16 bytes)
                           Downstream subcarrier Subcarriers 257 to 384. (R, W) (mandatory for modems that support
mask 3:                    NSCds > 256) (16 bytes)
                           Downstream subcarrier Subcarriers 385 to 512. (R, W) (mandatory for modems that support
mask 4:                    NSCds > 384) (16 bytes)
Mask valid:                This Boolean attribute controls and reports the operational status of the
                           downstream subcarrier mask attributes.
                           If this attribute is true (1), the downstream subcarrier mask represented
                           in this ME has been impressed on the DSL equipment.
                           If this attribute is false (0), the downstream subcarrier mask represented
                           in this ME has not been impressed on the DSL equipment. The default
                           value is false.
                           The value of this attribute can be modified by the ONT and OLT, as
                           follows:
                           •         If the OLT changes any of the four mask attributes or sets mask
                                     valid false, then mask valid is false.
                             •       If mask valid is false and the OLT sets mask valid true, the ONT
                                     impresses the downstream subcarrier mask data onto the DSL
                                     equipment.
