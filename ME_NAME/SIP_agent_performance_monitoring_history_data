9.9.14 SIP agent performance monitoring history data
NOTE – This managed entity was formerly known by the name SIP agent monitoring data.
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data for the associated VoIP SIP agent.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with a SIP agent config data or SIP config portal
object.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                            instance of the corresponding SIP agent config data. If a non-OMCI
                            configuration method is used for VoIP, the managed entity id is 0.
                            (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:          This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                            (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:      This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed entity
                            that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value attribute
                            number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
