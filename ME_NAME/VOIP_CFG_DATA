9.9.18 VoIP config data
The VoIP configuration data managed entity defines the configuration for VoIP in the ONT. The
OLT uses this ME to discover the VoIP signalling protocols and configuration methods supported
by this ONT. The OLT then uses this ME to select the desired signalling protocol and configuration
method. The entity is conditionally required for ONTs that offer VoIP services.
An ONT that supports VoIP services automatically creates an instance of this managed entity.
Relationships
One instance of the managed entity is associated with the ONT.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Available signalling      This attribute is a bit map that defines the VoIP signalling protocols
protocols:                supported in the ONT. Valid values are any combination of:
                          0             None, VoIP not supported.
                          1             SIP.

Signalling protocol used:  This attribute specifies the VoIP signalling protocol to use. Only one
                          type of protocol is allowed at a time. Valid values are:
                          0             None.
                          1             SIP.

Available VoIP            This attribute is a bit map that indicates the capabilities of the ONT with
configuration methods:  regard to VoIP service configuration:
                          1             ONT capable of using OMCI to configure its VoIP services.
                          2             ONT capable of working with configuration file retrieval to
                                        configure its VoIP services.
                          4             ONT capable of working with DSL Forum TR-69 to
                                        configure its VoIP services.
                          8             ONT capable of working with IETF sipping config
                                        framework to configure its VoIP services.
                          Bits 5..24 are reserved for future use. Bits 25..32 are reserved for
                          proprietary vendor configuration capabilities. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)

VoIP configuration        If this attribute is set to any value other than 0xFFFF, it points to a
address pointer:          network address managed entity, which indicates the address of the
                          server to contact using the method indicated in the VoIP configuration
                          method used attribute. This attribute is only relevant for non-OMCI
                          configuration methods.
                          If this attribute is set to 0xFFFF, no address is defined by this attribute.
                          However, the address may be defined by other methods, such as deriving
                          it from the ONT identifier attribute of the IP host config data ME and
                              using a well-known URI schema. (The default value is 0xFFFF.) (R, W)

                              1             Active:  Configuration was retrieved.

                              Other values are reserved. At ME instantiation, the ONT sets this
                              attribute to 0. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Retrieve profile:             This attribute provides a means by which the ONT may be notified that a
                              new VoIP profile should be retrieved. By setting this attribute, the OLT
                              triggers the ONT to retrieve a new profile. The actual value in the set
                              action is ignored because it is the action of setting that is important. (W)
                              (mandatory) (1 byte)
Profile version:              This attribute is a character string that identifies the version of the last
                              retrieved profile. (R) (mandatory) (25 bytes)
