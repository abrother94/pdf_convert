9.6.2    802.11 station management data 1
This managed entity organizes some of the data associated with an 802.11 station. The ONT
automatically creates or deletes an instance of this entity when it creates or deletes a PPTP 802.11
UNI instance.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with one instance of an [IEEE 802.11] interface.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                           instance of the physical path termination point 802.11 UNI. (R)
                           (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 medium               This attribute specifies the maximum amount of time, in TU, that a point
occupancy limit:           coordinator may control the use of the wireless medium without
                           relinquishing control for long enough to allow at least one instance of
                           DCF access to the medium. The default value of this attribute is 100 TU;
                           the maximum value is 1000. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 CF pollable:         The Boolean value true indicates that the STA is able to respond to a
                           CF-poll with a data frame within one SIFS time. The attribute is false if
                           the STA is not able to respond to a CF-Poll with a data frame within one
                           SIFS time. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 CFP period:          The attribute specifies the number of DTIM intervals between the start of
                           CFPs. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 CFP max              The attribute specifies the maximum duration of the CFP in TU that may
duration:                  be generated by the PCF. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 authentication       This attribute specifies the number of TU that a responding STA should
response timeout:          wait for the next frame in the authentication sequence. (R, W)
                           (mandatory) (4 bytes)
dot11 privacy option       When true, this Boolean attribute indicates that the [IEEE 802.11] WEP
implemented:               option is implemented. The default value of this attribute is false. (R)
                           (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 power                This attribute specifies the power management mode of the STA. When
management mode:           active (0), the station is not in power save mode. Power save mode is
                           specified by 1. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                        desired SSID parameter of the most recent MLME_Scan request. This
                        value may be modified by an external management entity and used by the
                        local SME to make decisions about the scanning process. (R, W)
                        (mandatory) (16 bytes)
dot11 desired SSID2:    This attribute contains the second half of the service set ID used in the
                        desired SSID parameter of the most recent MLME_Scan request. (R, W)
                        (mandatory) (16 bytes)
dot11 desired BSS type: This attribute specifies the type of BSS the station accepts when scanning
                        for a BSS with which to synchronize. The station filters probe response
                        frames and beacons on the basis of this attribute.
                        0 Infrastructure: The station only synchronizes with a BSS whose
                             capability information field has the ESS subfield set to 1.
                        1 Independent: The station only synchronizes with a BSS whose
                             capability information field has the IBSS subfield set to 1.
                        2 Any: The station may synchronize to either type of BSS.
                        (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 operational rate This attribute specifies the set of data rates (maximum 8) at which the
set:                    station may transmit data. Each octet contains a value representing a rate.
                        Each rate lies within the range 2..127, corresponding to data rates in
                        increments of 500 kbit/s from 1 Mbit/s to 63.5 Mbit/s. If fewer than 8 data
                        rates are specified, each of the unused bytes is set to 0. This value is
                        reported in transmitted beacon, probe request, probe response, association
                        request, association response, reassociation request and reassociation
                        response frames, and is used to determine whether a BSS with which the
                        station desires to synchronize is suitable. (R, W) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
dot11 beacon period:    This attribute specifies the number of TU that a station uses for
                        scheduling beacon transmissions. This value is transmitted in beacon and

                        between transmission of beacon frames containing a TIM element whose
                        DTIM count field is 0. This value is transmitted in the DTIM period field
                        of beacon frames. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 association       This attribute specifies the number of TU that a requesting STA should
response timeout:       wait for a response to a transmitted association-request MMPDU. (R, W)
