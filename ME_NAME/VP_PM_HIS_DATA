9.13.10 VP performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data associated with a VP network CTP-G.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the VP network CTP-G
managed entity. The performance of upstream ATM flows is reported.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                linked to an instance of the VP network CTP-G. (R, Set-by-create)
                                (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:              This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute
                                interval. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:          This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                                entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                                attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional.
                                (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Lost C = 0 + 1 cells:           This attribute counts background cell loss. It cannot distinguish
                                between cells lost because of header bit errors, ATM-level header
                                errors, cell policing, or buffer overflows. It records only loss of
                                information, independent of the priority of the cell. (R) (mandatory)
                                (2 bytes)
                               between cells lost because of header bit errors, ATM-level header
                               errors, cell policing or buffer overflows. It records only loss of high
                               priority cells. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Misinserted cells:             This attribute counts cells that are misrouted to a monitored VP. (R)
                               (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Transmitted C = 0 + 1          This attribute counts cells originated by the transmitting end point
cells:                         (i.e., backward reporting is assumed). (R) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
Transmitted C = 0 cells:       This attribute counts high priority cells originated by the transmitting
                               end point (i.e., backward reporting is assumed). (R) (mandatory)
                               (5 bytes)
Impaired blocks:               This severely errored cell block counter is incremented whenever
                               one of the following events takes place:  the number of misinserted
                               cells reaches its threshold, the number of bipolar violations reaches
                               its threshold, or the number of lost cells reaches its threshold.
                               Threshold values are based on vendor-operator negotiation. (R)
                               (mandatory) (2 bytes)

10       ONT management and control channel (OMCC)
A GEM connection shall be provisioned for the OMCC (the use of ATM mode is deprecated).
[ITU-T G.984.3] specifies a PLOAM message that activates a PortID between the OLT and ONT
processors. The PortID value for the management channel of each ONT is programmed by the OLT
using this message. A grant flow must be allocated by the MAC layer of the OLT for upstream
OMCC traffic of each ONT.
The following performance requirements related to the OMCC are considered with input from
operators:
a)       The upstream traffic on each OMCC should not exceed x bandwidth, where x is based on
         the operator's requirement.
b)       An upstream OMCC packet should always be put in the high priority queue; the constraints
         on the downstream OMCC packets are out of the scope of this Recommendation, as this is
         completely under control of the OLT.
c)        Message response time:  The system should support response times that do not exceed
          one second for high priority protocol handling messages and three seconds for low priority
          protocol handling messages.
