9.8.11 TU performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data from SDH TUs. Most of the parameters
are received from the GEM layer, and may therefore be considered egress PM. For the most part,
ingress PM is collected at the CES managed entity.
Instances of this ME are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity may exist for each instance of the TU CTP managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                               entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                               linked to an instance of a TU CTP. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                               (2 bytes)
Interval end time:             This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                               (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:         This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and
                               2 managed entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W,
                               Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Positive pointer               This attribute counts pointer increments generated. (R) (mandatory)
justification:                 (4 bytes)

seconds:                       (4 bytes)
Remote-end severely block This attribute counts far-end severely block errored seconds. (R)
error seconds:                 (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Near-end background               This attribute counts near-end background block errors. (R)
block error:                      (mandatory) (4 bytes)

Near-end unavailable              This attribute counts near-end unavailable seconds. (R) (mandatory)
seconds:                          (4 bytes)
Remote-end unavailable            This attribute counts far-end unavailable seconds. (R) (mandatory)
