9.2.9    GAL TDM profile
This managed entity organizes data that describes the GTC adaptation layer processing functions of
the ONT for TDM services. [ITU-T G.984.3] explains that the GEM adaptation layer generates a
125 μs GEM frame that accommodates TDM traffic. The length of the TDM partition in the GEM
frame depends on the TDM UNI bit rate. The clock recovery function and structured data transfer
function are not necessary because the GEM is terminated in the PON section.
The receiver of the GEM adaptation layer should check for loss of GEM frame once every 125 μs.
This managed entity is created and deleted on request of the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the GEM
interworking termination point managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
GEM frame loss                This attribute is the GEM frame loss integration period in milliseconds.
integration period:           If GEM frame loss persists for this period, the GEM interworking
                              termination point managed entity associated with this entity generates a
                              GEM frame starvation alarm. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
