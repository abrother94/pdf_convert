9.9.19 SIP config portal
The SIP config portal managed entity provides a way for the OLT to discover the configuration text
delivered to an ONT by a non-OMCI SIP VoIP configuration method (TR-69, Sipping framework,
etc.). Text retrieved from this ME is not required to be understood by the OLT or EMS, but it may
be useful for human or vendor-specific analysis tools. See also the MGC config portal ME.
An instance of this managed entity may be created by an ONT that supports non-OMCI SIP
configuration. It is not reported during a MIB upload.

One instance of this managed entity is associated with the ONT.
Attributes
Managed entity ID:           This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                             There is one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Configuration text table: This attribute is used to pass a textual representation of the VoIP
                             configuration back to the OLT. The contents are vendor-specific. The
                             get, get next sequence must be used with this attribute since its size is
                             unspecified. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R)
                             (mandatory) (x bytes)
Actions
Get, get next

  Number      Attribute value change                                  Description
      1      Configuration text         Indicates an update to the VoIP configuration from a non-OMCI
                                        interface. Because the attribute is a table, the AVC contains no
                                        information about its value. The OLT must use the get, get next
                                        action sequence if it wishes to obtain the updated attribute content.
