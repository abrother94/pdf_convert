9.8.1     Physical path termination point CES UNI
This managed entity represents the point at a CES UNI in the ONT where the physical path
terminates and physical level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•         When the ONT has CES ports built into its factory configuration.
•         When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of CES type.
•         When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of CES
          type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of CES
          ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
          port mapping package that specifies CES ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a CES circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a CES circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each real or preprovisioned CES port. It can
be linked from a pseudowire TP, a logical N x 64 kbit/s CTP, or an interworking TP.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the
                              UNI. The first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second
                              byte is the port ID, with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Expected type:                The following coding is used for this attribute:
                              0           Autosense.
                              1 to 254    One of the values from Table 9.1.5-1 that is compatible
                                          with a CES circuit pack.
                              Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                              (mandatory) (1 byte)
Sensed type:                  If the value of expected type is not 0, then the value of sensed type
                              equals the value of expected type. If expected type = 0, then the
                              value of sensed type is one of the compatible values from
                              Table 9.1.5-1. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0
                              or to the value that reflects the physically present equipment. (R)
                              (mandatory if the ONT supports circuit packs with configurable
                              interface types, e.g., C1.5/2/6.3) (1 byte)
CES loopback                  This attribute specifies and reports the loopback configuration of the
configuration:                physical interface.

                            for a DS1 interface, the ONT assigns the value 0 for non-power feed
                            type DS1 and the value 6 for power feed type DS1. Upon ME
