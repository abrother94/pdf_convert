9.7.1   Physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 1
This managed entity represents the point where physical paths terminate on an xDSL CO modem
(xTU-C). The xDSL managed entity family is used for ADSL and VDSL2 services (an existing
legacy family of VDSL managed entities remains valid for [ITU-T G.993.1] VDSL. It is
documented in [ITU-T G.983.2]).
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•       When the ONT has xDSL ports built into its factory configuration.
•       When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of xDSL type.
•       When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of xDSL
        type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of xDSL
        ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
        port mapping package that specifies xDSL ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an xDSL circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an xDSL circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a real or preprovisioned
xDSL port.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                               entity. This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the
                               UNI. The six least significant bits of the first byte are the slot id,
                               defined in clause 9.1.5. The two most significant bits indicate the
                               channel number in some of the implicitly linked MEs, and must be 0
                               in the PPTP itself. This reduces the possible number of physical slots
                               to 64. The second byte is the port ID, with range 1..255. (R)
                               (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loopback configuration:        This attribute represents the loopback configuration of this physical
                               interface.
                               0   No loopback.
                               1   Loopback2 – A loopback at the ONT toward the OLT. The OLT
                                   can execute a physical level loopback test after loopback2 is set.
                               Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                               (mandatory) (1 byte)
Administrative state:          This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by
                               this managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all
                               user functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs
                               for this managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no
                               longer generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is
                               outside the scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory)
                               (1 byte)
Operational state:             This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable
                               of performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled
                               (1). (R) (optional) (1 byte)
xDSL line configuration        This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL line configuration
profile:                       profiles (part 1, 2 and 3) managed entities, and if [ITU-T G.993.2]
                               VDSL2 is supported, also to a VDSL2 line configuration extensions
                               ME. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0, a null
                               pointer. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
xDSL subcarrier masking        This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL subcarrier masking
downstream profile:            downstream profile managed entity. Upon ME instantiation, the
                               ONT sets this attribute to 0, a null pointer. (R, W) (mandatory)
                               (2 bytes)
xDSL subcarrier masking        This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL subcarrier masking
upstream profile:              upstream profile managed entity. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT
                               sets this attribute to 0, a null pointer. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
xDSL downstream PSD            This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL PSD mask profile
mask profile:                  managed entity that defines downstream parameters. Upon ME
                               instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0, a null pointer. (R, W)
                               (mandatory) (2 bytes)
xDSL downstream RFI            This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL downstream RFI
bands profile:                 bands profile managed entity. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets
                               this attribute to 0, a null pointer. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ARC:                           See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:                  See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Modem type:                    This attribute specifies the modem type. If the hardware cannot
                               support the requested modem type, the ONT should deny the
                               provisioning command. For backward compatibility, the attribute is
                               optional, with a default of ATM.
                               0   Undefined.
                               1   ATM (default).
                               2   PTM (Ethernet).
                               (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Upstream PSD mask profile: This attribute points to an instance of the xDSL PSD mask profile
                               that defines upstream parameters. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT
                               sets this attribute to 0, a null pointer. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)

 NOTE 1 – The data rate upshift and downshift notifications are triggered by individual bearer channels.
 The alarms may be declared against the UNI itself, or against one of the bearer channels. In the latter case,
 the two MSBs of the instance identifier in the alarm message specify the bearer channel.
 NOTE 2 – These alarms are meaningful only for ATM transport. The alarms may be declared against the
 UNI itself, or against one of the bearer channels. In the latter case, the two MSBs of the instance identifier
 in the alarm message specify the bearer channel.
