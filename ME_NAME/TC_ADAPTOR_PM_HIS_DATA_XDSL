9.7.25 TC adaptor performance monitoring history data xDSL
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data of an xTU-C to xTU-R ATM data path.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with an instance of a physical path
termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                               entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                               linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                               UNI. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:             This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                               (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:         This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                               entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                               attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                               Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Near-end HEC violation         This attribute counts near-end HEC anomalies in the ATM data path.
count:                         (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Near-end delineated total      This attribute counts the total number of cells passed through the cell
cell count (CD-P):             delineation and HEC function process operating on the ATM data
                               path while in the SYNC state. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Near-end user total cell       This attribute counts the total number of cells in the ATM data path
count:                         delivered at the V-C interface. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Near-end idle cell bit error This attribute counts cells with bit errors in the ATM data path idle
count:                         payload received at the near end. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Far-end HEC violation          This attribute counts far-end HEC anomalies in the ATM data path.
count:                         (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Far-end delineated total cell This attribute counts the total number of cells passed through the cell
count:                         delineation process and HEC function operating on the ATM data
                               path while in the SYNC state. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Far-end user total cell        This attribute counts the total number of cells in the ATM data path
count:                         delivered at the T-R interface. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Far-end idle cell bit error    This attribute counts cells with bit errors in the ATM data path idle
count:                         payload received at the far end. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
