9.3.17 Radius performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance statistics on an ONT's radius client, particularly as related
to its 802.1X operation.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an ONT.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                               Through an identical ID (namely 0), this managed entity is implicitly
                               linked to an instance of a dot1X configuration profile.
                               (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:             This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                               (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:         This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                               entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                               attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                               Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Access-request packets         This attribute counts transmitted radius access-request messages,
transmitted:                   including retransmissions. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Access-request                 This attribute counts radius access-request retransmissions. (R)
retransmission count:          (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Access-challenge packets       This attribute counts received radius access-challenge messages. (R)
received:                      (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Access-accept packets          This attribute counts received radius access-accept messages. (R)
received:                      (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Access-reject packets          This attribute counts received radius access-reject messages. (R)
received:                      (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Invalid radius packets         This attribute counts received invalid radius messages. (R)
received:                      (mandatory) (4 bytes)
