9.12.7 Threshold data 2
Together with an instance of the threshold data 1 ME, an instance of this managed entity contains
threshold values for the performance monitoring parameters maintained in one or more instances of
history data managed entities.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
Refer to the relationships of the threshold data 1 ME.
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. Its
                         value is the same as that of the paired threshold data 1 instance. (R,
                         Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                         The following seven attributes specify threshold values for seven thresholded counters in associated
                         PM history data MEs. The definition of each PM history ME includes a table that links each
                         thresholded counter to one of these threshold value attributes.
Threshold value 8:       (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
