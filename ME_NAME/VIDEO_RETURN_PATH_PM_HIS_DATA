9.13.8 Video return path performance monitoring history data
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity may exist for each ONT. It is created by the OLT.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                         instance of the video return path service profile. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:       This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval. (R)
                         (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data           This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2 managed
1/2 id:                  entities that contain PM threshold values. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                         (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Rx total bursts:         This attribute counts the total number of bursts detected. (R) (optional)
                         (4 bytes)
Rx good bursts:          This attribute counts bursts detected and received correctly. (R) (optional)
                         (4 bytes)
Rx FEC corrected         This attribute counts bursts detected with errors, but which were
bursts:                  successfully corrected using FEC. (R) (optional) (4 bytes)
Rx missed bursts:        This attribute counts bursts detected that were not received correctly (e.g.,
                         errors that were FEC uncorrectable). (R) (optional) (4 bytes)
Rx min power:            This attribute is a low water mark that reports the lowest power level of all
                         bursts received in the current interval, in units of dBmV. (R) (optional)
                         (1 byte)
Rx max power:            This attribute is a high water mark that reports the highest power level of
                         all bursts received in the current interval, in units of dBmV. (R) (optional)
                         (1 byte)
Rx current power:        This attribute reports the power level of the latest burst received, in units
                         of dBmV. (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Rx FEC corrected         This attribute counts the number of symbols that were corrected through
symbols:                 the use of FEC. It provides an indicator of the bit error rate of the link. (R)
                         (optional) (4 bytes)
