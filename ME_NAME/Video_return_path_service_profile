9.13.7 Video return path service profile
This managed entity models an RF video return path. The ONT creates an instance autonomously if
it supports this function.
Further description of the video return path (VRP) feature appears in Appendix IV, that defines
transport methods required to support the video return path function. This includes a brief
description of the relevant aspects of the two return path specifications supported. It also includes
formatting for carriage of VRP data over the PON data path.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity may exist for each ONT.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          There is one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Administrative            This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
state:                    managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                          functions are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this managed
                          entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer generated.
                          Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the scope of this
                          Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:        This attribute reports whether the managed entity is currently capable of
                          performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1). (R)
                          (optional) (1 byte)
ARC:                      See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:             See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
VRP mode:                This attribute specifies the format to be used for the VRP service:
