9.1.8     Port mapping package-G
This managed entity provides a way to map a heterogeneous set of physical path termination points
(ports) to a parent equipment, which may be a cardholder or the ONT itself. It could be useful, for
example, if a single plug-in circuit pack contained a PON ANI as port 1, a video UNI as port 2, and
a craft UNI as port 3. It also provides an option for an integrated ONT to represent its ports without
the use of virtual cardholders and virtual circuit packs.
If the port mapping package-G is supported for the ONT as a whole, it is automatically created by
the ONT. If the port mapping package-G is supported for plug-in circuit packs, it is created and
destroyed by the ONT when the corresponding circuit pack is installed or preprovisioned in a
cardholder.
The port list attributes specify ports 1..64 sequentially. Each port list contains a sequence of ME
types, as defined in Table 11-2. These ME type codes define what kind of PPTP or ANI
corresponds to the specific port number. For example, for a circuit pack with 4 POTS ports,
2 VDSL ports, and 1 video port, numbered sequentially in that order, the attributes would be coded:
Max ports:       7
Port list 1:      53, 53, 53, 53, 117, 117, 82, 0
Port list 2..8:   All zero
Relationships
A port mapping package-G may be contained by an ONT-G or a cardholder.
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                         instance of the ONT-G or cardholder. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Max ports:               This attribute indicates the largest port number contained in the port list
                         attributes. Ports are numbered from 1 to this maximum, possibly with
                         embedded 0 entries, but no port may exist beyond the maximum. (R)
                         (mandatory) (1 byte)
                         Each of the following attributes is a list of 8 ports, in increasing port number
                         sequence. Each list entry is a two-byte field containing the managed entity
                         type of the UNI or ANI corresponding to the port number. Managed entity
                         types are defined in Table 11-2. Placeholders for unused port numbers are
                         indicated with the value 0.
Port list 1:             (R) (mandatory) (16 bytes)
Port list 2:             (R) (optional) (16 bytes)
Port list 3:             (R) (optional) (16 bytes)
Port list 4:             (R) (optional) (16 bytes)
Port list 5:             (R) (optional) (16 bytes)
Port list 6:             (R) (optional) (16 bytes)
Port list 7:             (R) (optional) (16 bytes)
Port list 8:             (R) (optional) (16 bytes)
