9.4.8    ICMP performance monitoring history data 1
This managed entity contains performance monitoring related to received ICMP messages at an IP
router. An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the IP router service profile.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of the IP router service profile. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                              (2 bytes)
Interval end time:            This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval. (R)
                              (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:        This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2 managed
                              entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Icmp in msgs counter:         This attribute counts received ICMP messages. It includes those also

Icmp in errors counter: This attribute counts ICMP messages that were received but had
                              ICMP-specific errors: bad ICMP checksums, bad length, etc. (R)
                              (mandatory) (4 bytes)

counter:                      (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp in parm probs            This attribute counts received ICMP parameter problem messages. (R)
counter:                      (mandatory) (4 bytes)

counter:                      (4 bytes)
Icmp in echos counter:       This attribute counts received ICMP echo (request) messages. (R)
                             (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp in echo reps            This attribute counts received ICMP echo reply messages. (R)
counter:                     (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp in timestamps           This attribute counts received ICMP timestamp (request) messages. (R)
counter:                     (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Icmp in timestamp reps This attribute counts received ICMP timestamp reply messages. (R)
counter:                     (mandatory) (4 bytes)
