9.13.6 AAL 5 performance monitoring history data
NOTE – Except for its name, this managed entity is substantially identical to the AAL 5 protocol monitoring
history dataB-PON defined in [ITU-T G.983.2].
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data as a result of performing segmentation
and reassembly (SAR) and convergence sublayer (CS) level protocol monitoring. Instances of this
managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of an interworking VCC
termination point that represents AAL 5 functions.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                         instance of the interworking VCC termination point. (R, Set-by-create)
                         (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:       This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval. (R)
                         (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data           This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed entity
1/2 id:                  that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value attribute
                         number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                         (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Sum of invalid CS        This attribute counts the sum of invalid convergence sublayer (CS) field
field errors:            errors. For AAL type 5, this attribute is a single count of the number of CS
                         PDUs discarded due to one of the following error conditions: invalid
                         common part indicator (CPI), oversized received SDU, or length violation.
                         (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
CRC violations:          This attribute counts CRC violations detected on incoming SAR PDUs.
                         (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Reassembly timer         This attribute counts reassembly timer expirations. (R) (mandatory if
expirations:             reassembly timer is implemented) (4 bytes)
Buffer overflows:        This attribute counts the number of times there was not enough buffer
                         space for a reassembled packet. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Encap protocol           This attribute counts the number of times that [IETF RFC 1483]
errors:                  encapsulation protocol detected a bad header. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)

       NOTE – This number associates the TCA with the specified threshold value attribute of the
       threshold data 1 managed entity.
