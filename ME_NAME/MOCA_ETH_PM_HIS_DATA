9.10.2 MoCA Ethernet performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data for a MoCA Ethernet interface. Instances
of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the PPTP MoCA UNI managed
entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                            instance of the physical path termination point MoCA UNI. (R,
                            Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:          This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval. (R)
                            (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:      This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2 managed
                            entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                            Incoming PM refers to upstream traffic received on the UNI; outgoing PM refers to downstream
                            traffic transmitted on the UNI.
