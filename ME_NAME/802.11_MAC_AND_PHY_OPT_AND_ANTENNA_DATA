9.6.5   802.11 MAC and PHY operation and antenna data
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this entity whenever it creates an instance of PPTP
802.11 UNI.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity exists for each [IEEE 802.11] interface.
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                            entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                            linked to an instance of the physical path termination point 802.11
                            UNI. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 MAC address:          Unique MAC address assigned to the STA. (R) (mandatory)
                            (6 bytes)
dot11 RTS threshold:        This attribute specifies the number of octets in an MPDU, at or
                            below which no RTS/CTS handshake is performed. An RTS/CTS
                            handshake is performed at the beginning of any frame exchange
                            sequence where the PDU is of type data or management, the MPDU
                            has an individual address in the address1 field, and the length of the
                            MPDU is greater than this threshold. Setting this attribute to be
                            larger than the maximum MSDU size has the effect of turning off the
                            RTS/CTS handshake for all data and management frames transmitted
                            by this STA. Setting this attribute to 0 has the effect of turning on the
                            RTS/CTS handshake for all data and management frames transmitted
                            by this STA. The default value of this attribute is 2347. (R, W)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 short retry limit:    This attribute specifies the maximum number of transmission
                            attempts of a frame whose length is less than or equal to dot11 RTS
                            threshold, before a failure condition is indicated. The default value of
                            this attribute is 7. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 long retry limit:     This attribute specifies the maximum number of transmission
                            attempts of a frame whose length is greater than dot11 RTS
                            threshold, before a failure condition is indicated. The default value of
                            this attribute is 4. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 fragmentation         This attribute specifies the maximum size, in octets, of the MPDU
threshold:                  that may be delivered to the PHY. An MSDU is broken into
                            fragments if its size exceeds the value of this attribute after adding
                            MAC headers and trailers. An MSDU or MMPDU is fragmented
                            when the resulting frame has an individual address in the address1
                            field, and the length of the frame is larger than this threshold. The
                            default value for this attribute is the lesser of 2346 or the aMPDU
                            max length of the attached PHY. The attribute value may never be
                            set to exceed this limit, and may never be less than 256. (R, W)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 max transmit MSDU The max transmit MSDU lifetime is the elapsed time in TU, from the
lifetime:                   initial transmission of an MSDU until further attempts to transmit it
                            are terminated. The default value of this attribute is 512. (R, W)
                            (mandatory) (4 bytes)
dot11 max receive lifetime:  The max receive lifetime is the elapsed time in TU, from the initial
                            reception of a fragmented MMPDU or MSDU until further attempts
                            to reassemble the MMPDU or MSDU are terminated. The default
                            value is 512. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
                              PLCP and PMD. Currently defined values and their corresponding
                              PHY types are:
                              1 FHSS 2.4 GHz.
                              2 DSSS 2.4 GHz.

dot11 current reg domain:     The current regulatory domain this instance of the PMD is
                              supporting. This object corresponds to one of the reg domains listed

dot11 temp type:              There are different operating temperature requirements according to
                              anticipated environmental conditions. This attribute describes the
                              current PHY's operating temperature range capability. Currently
                              defined values and their corresponding temperature ranges are:
                              1    Type 1 – Commercial range, 0 to 40 degrees C.
                              2    Type 2 – Industrial range, –30 to 70 degrees C.

                              (2 bytes)
dot11 diversity support:      This attribute indicates the ONT's support for diversity, encoded as:
                              1 Diversity is available and is performed over the fixed list of
                                   antennas defined by the dot11 diversity selection rx attribute
                                   values of the set of general purpose object ME instances of

                              3 Diversity is supported and control of diversity is also available,
                                   in which case the corresponding 802.11 general purpose object,
                                   object type 3, dot11 diversity selection rx attribute can be
                                   dynamically modified by the LME.
                              (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)

                              diversity support indicates that diversity is not supported. The
                              attribute is only permitted to point to an 802.11 PPTP whose 802.11
