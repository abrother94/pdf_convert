9.7.12 xDSL line inventory and status data part 1
This managed entity contains part 1 of the line inventory and status data for an xDSL line. The
ONT automatically creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity upon the creation or
deletion of a physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a physical path termination
point xDSL UNI part 1.

Initialization success/failure This parameter represents the success or failure cause of the last full
cause:                             initialization performed on the line. It is coded as follows:
                                   0    Successful
                                   1    Configuration error
                                        This error occurs with inconsistencies in configuration
                                        parameters, e.g., when the line is initialized in an xDSL
                                        transmission system whose xTU does not support the configured
                                        maximum delay or the configured minimum or maximum data
                                        rate for one or more bearer channels.
                                   2 Configuration not feasible on the line
                                        This error occurs if the minimum data rate cannot be achieved on
                                        the line with the minimum noise margin, maximum PSD level,
                                        maximum delay and maximum bit error ratio for one or more
                                        bearer channels.
                                   3 Communication problem
                                        This error occurs, e.g., due to corrupted messages, bad syntax
                                        messages, if no common mode can be selected in the G.994.1
                                        handshake procedure, or due to a timeout.
                                   4 No peer xTU detected
                                        This error occurs if the peer xTU is not powered or not connected
                                        or if the line is too long to allow detection of a peer xTU.
                                   5 Any other or unknown initialization failure cause
                                   (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
