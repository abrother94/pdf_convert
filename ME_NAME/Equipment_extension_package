9.1.9    Equipment extension package
This managed entity supports optional extensions to circuit pack managed entities. If the circuit
pack supports these features, the ONT creates and deletes this managed entity along with its
associated real or virtual circuit pack.
Relationships
An equipment extension package may be contained by an ONT-G or cardholder.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                         instance of the ONT-G or cardholder. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                       example physical security detectors at an enclosure. Each pair of bits is
                       defined as follows:
                       00      Sense point disabled (default).
                       01      Report contact closure.
                       10      Report contact open.
                       11      Sense point disabled (same as 00).
                       If the byte is represented in binary as 0B hhgg ffee ddcc bbaa, bits hh
                       correspond to sense point 1, while bits aa correspond to sense point 8.
                       (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
                       NOTE â€“ Some specific sense point applications are already defined on the ONT-G
                       managed entity. It is the vendor's choice how to configure and report sense points
                       that appear both generically and specifically.
Contact closure        This attribute provisions an ONT that supports external contact closure
output:                outputs, for example sump pump or air conditioner activation at an ONT
                       enclosure. A contact point is said to be released when it is not energized.
                       Whether this corresponds to an open or a closed electrical circuit depends
                       on the ONT's wiring options. Upon ONT initialization, all contact points
                       should go to the released state.
                       If the byte is represented in binary as 0B hhgg ffee ddcc bbaa, bits hh
                       correspond to contact output point 1, while bits aa correspond to contact
                       output point 8.
                       On write, the bits of this attribute have the following meaning:
                       0x       No change to contact output point state.
                       10       Release contact output point.
                       11       Operate contact output point.
                       On read, the left bit in each pair should be set to 0 at the ONT and ignored
                       at the OLT. The right bit indicates a released output point with 0 and an
                       operated point with 1. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
