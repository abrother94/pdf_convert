9.5.4   Ethernet performance monitoring history data 3
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data associated with an Ethernet interface. It
includes parameters defined in the Ethernet statistics group of [b-IETF RFC 2819] that are not
already covered by previously defined Ethernet monitoring MEs. The received direction is from the
CPE toward the network (upstream).
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the physical path termination
point Ethernet UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                               Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                               instance of the PPTP Ethernet UNI. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                               (2 bytes)
Interval end time:             This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                               (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:         This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                               entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                               attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                               Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Drop events:                   The total number of events in which packets were dropped due to lack
                               of resources. This is not necessarily the number of packets dropped; it
                               is the number of times this event was detected. (R) (mandatory)
                               (4 bytes)
Octets:                        The total number of octets received from the CPE, including those in
                               bad packets, excluding framing bits, but including FCS. (R)
                               (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Packets:                       The total number of packets received, including bad packets,
                               broadcast packets and multicast packets. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Broadcast packets:             The total number of received good packets directed to the broadcast
                               address. This does not include multicast packets. (R) (mandatory)
                               (4 bytes)
Multicast packets:           The total number of received good packets directed to a multicast
                             address. This does not include broadcast packets. (R) (mandatory)
                             (4 bytes)
Undersize packets:           The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets
                             long but were otherwise well formed (excluding framing bits, but
                             including FCS octets). (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Fragments:                   The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets
                             long, excluding framing bits but including FCS octets, and had either
                             a bad frame check sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets
                             (FCS error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets
                             (alignment error). It is entirely normal for this attribute to increment.
                             This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences
                             due to collisions) and noise hits. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Jabbers:                     The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518
                             octets, excluding framing bits but including FCS octets, and had either
                             a bad frame check sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets
                             (FCS error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets
                             (alignment error). The range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and
                             150 ms. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Packets 64 octets:           The total number of received packets (including bad packets) that

Packets 65 to 127 octets:    The total number of received packets (including bad packets) that
                             were 65..127 octets long, excluding framing bits but including FCS.
                             (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Packets 128 to 255 octets:   The total number of packets (including bad packets) received that
                             were 128..255 octets long, excluding framing bits but including FCS.
                             (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Packets 256 to 511 octets:   The total number of packets (including bad packets) received that
