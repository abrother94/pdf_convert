9.3.8    MAC bridge port bridge table data
This managed entity reports status data associated with a bridge port. The ONT automatically
creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity upon the creation or deletion of a MAC bridge
port configuration data.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a MAC bridge port
configuration data managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of the MAC bridge port configuration data ME. (R)
                              (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Bridge table:                 This attribute lists known MAC destination addresses, whether they are
                              learned or statically assigned, whether packets having them as
                              destination addresses are filtered or forwarded, and their ages. Each
                              entry contains:
                              Information (2 bytes).
                              MAC address (6 bytes).
                            The information bits are assigned as described below.

                            Upon ME instantiation, this attribute is an empty list. (R) (mandatory)
