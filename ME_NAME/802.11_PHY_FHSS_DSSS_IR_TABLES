9.6.6    802.11 PHY FHSS DSSS IR tables
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity may exist for each instance of an [IEEE 802.11] interface. The
ONT automatically creates an instance of this entity whenever it creates an instance of the PPTP
802.11 UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:           This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                             entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                             linked to an instance of the physical path termination point 802.11
                             UNI. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 hop time:              This attribute reports the time in microseconds for the PMD to
                             change from channel 2 to channel 80. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 current channel        This attribute provisions the channel number of the RF synthesizer.

dot11 max dwell time:        This attribute reports the maximum time in TU that the transmitter
                             operates on a single channel. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 current dwell time:    This attribute provisions the time in TU that the transmitter may
                             operate on a single channel. The default is 19 TU. (R, W)
                             (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 current set:           This attribute provisions the set of patterns to be used by the PHY
                             LME to determine the hop sequence. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 current pattern:       This attribute provisions the pattern to be used by the PHY LME to
                             determine the hop sequence. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 current index:         This attribute provisions the index value to be used by the PHY LME
                             to determine the current channel number. (R, W) (mandatory)
                             (1 byte)
dot11 current channel:       This attribute provisions the operating frequency channel to be used
                             by the DSSS PHY. Valid channel numbers are defined in
                             clause 15.4.6.2 of [IEEE 802.11]. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                               values are:
                               0x01     Energy detect only (ED only).
                               0x02     Carrier sense only (CS only).
                               0x04     Carrier sense and energy detect (ED and CS).
                               or the sum of any of these values. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 current CCA mode:        This attribute provisions the CCA method to be used by the PHY.
                               Valid values are:
                               0x01     Energy detect only (ED only).
                               0x02     Carrier sense only (CS only).
                               0x04     Carrier sense and energy detect (ED and CS).
                               (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 ED threshold:            This attribute provisions the energy detect threshold to be used by
                               the DSSS PHY. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
                               Together, the following two attributes specify when energy detected
                               in the channel can be ignored. Units are in time ticks.
dot11 CCA watchdog             (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
timer max:
dot11 CCA watchdog             (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
count max:
dot11 CCA watchdog             This attribute provisions the minimum value to which the dot11
timer min:                     CCA watchdog timer max can be set. Units are time ticks. (R, W)
                               (mandatory) (4 bytes)
dot11 CCA watchdog             This attribute provisions the minimum value to which the dot11
count min:                     CCA watchdog count can be set. Units are time ticks. (R, W)
