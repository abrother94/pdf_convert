9.9.2    SIP user data
The SIP user data defines the user-specific configuration attributes associated with a specific VoIP
CTP. This entity is conditionally required for ONTs that offer VoIP SIP services. If a non-OMCI
interface is used to manage SIP for VoIP, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI interface supplies
the necessary data, which may be read back to the OLT via the SIP config portal ME.
An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT. A SIP user data instance is
required for each POTS UNI port using SIP protocol and configured by OMCI.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with one VoIP voice CTP managed entity and a
PPTP POTS UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
SIP agent pointer:            This attribute points to the SIP agent config data ME to be used for
                              signalling. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
User part AOR:                This attribute points to a large string that contains the user
                              identification part of the address of record. This can take the form of
                              an alphanumeric string or the subscriber's directory number. The
                              value 0xFFFF is a null pointer. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                              (2 bytes)
SIP display name:             This ASCII string attribute defines the customer id used for the
                              display attribute in outgoing SIP messages. The default value is null
                              (all zero bytes). (R, W) (mandatory) (25 bytes)
Username/password:            This attribute points to an authentication security method ME that
                              contains the SIP user name and password used for authentication.
                              0xFFFF indicates no username/password. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Voicemail server SIP URI: This attribute points to a network address ME that contains the name
                              (IP address or URI) of the SIP voicemail server for SIP signalling
                              messages. The default value 0xFFFF is a null pointer. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Voicemail subscription        This attribute defines the voicemail subscription expiration time in
expiration time:              seconds. If this value is 0, the SIP agent uses an
                              implementation-specific value. The default value of this attribute is
                              3600 seconds. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Network dial plan pointer: This attribute points to a network dial plan table. The default value
                              0xFFFF is a null pointer. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Application services profile This attribute points to a VoIP application services profile. The
pointer:                      default value 0xFFFF is a null pointer. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Feature code pointer:         This attribute points to the VoIP feature access codes ME for this
                              subscriber. The default value 0xFFFF is a null pointer. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                                  provides the analogue telephony adaptor (ATA) function. The default
                                  value 0xFFFF is a null pointer. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                                  (2 bytes)
Release timer:                    This attribute contains a release timer defined in seconds. The value 0
                                  specifies that the ONT is to use its internal default. The default value
                                  of this attribute is 10 seconds. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ROH timer:                        This attribute defines the time in seconds for the receiver off hook
                                  condition before ROH tone is applied. The value 0 disables ROH
                                  timing. The default value is 15 seconds. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
