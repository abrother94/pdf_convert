9.5.2      Ethernet performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects some of the performance monitoring data for an Ethernet interface.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the physical path termination
point Ethernet UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:               This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                                 Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                                 instance of the physical path termination point Ethernet UNI. (R,
                                 Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:               This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                                 (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:    This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2 managed
                          entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                          (mandatory) (2 bytes)
FCS errors:               This attribute counts frames received on a particular interface that were
                          an integral number of octets in length but failed the frame check
                          sequence (FCS) check. The count is incremented when the MAC service
                          returns the frameCheckError status to the link layer control (LLC) or
                          other MAC user. Received frames for which multiple error conditions
                          are obtained are counted according to the error status presented to the
                          LLC. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Excessive collision       This attribute counts frames whose transmission failed due to excessive
counter:                  collisions. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Late collision counter:   This attribute counts the number of times that a collision was detected
                          later than 512 bit times into the transmission of a packet. (R)
                          (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Frames too long:          This attribute counts received frames that exceeded the maximum
                          permitted frame size. The count is incremented when the MAC service
                          returns the frameTooLong status to the LLC. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Buffer overflows on       This attribute counts the number of times that the receive buffer
receive:                  overflowed. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Buffer overflows on       This attribute counts the number of times that the transmit buffer
transmit:                 overflowed. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Single collision frame    This attribute counts successfully transmitted frames whose transmission
counter:                  was delayed by exactly one collision. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Multiple collisions frame This attribute counts successfully transmitted frames whose transmission
counter:                  was delayed by more than one collision. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
SQE counter:              This attribute counts the number of times that the SQE test error
                          message was generated by the PLS sublayer. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Deferred transmission     This attribute counts frames whose first transmission attempt was
counter:                  delayed because the medium was busy. The count does not include
                          frames involved in collisions. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Internal MAC transmit This attribute counts frames whose transmission failed due to an internal
error counter:            MAC sublayer transmit error. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Carrier sense error       This attribute counts the number of times that carrier sense was lost or
counter:                  never asserted when attempting to transmit a frame. (R) (mandatory)
                          (4 bytes)
Alignment error counter:  This attribute counts received frames that were not an integral number of
                          octets in length and did not pass the FCS check. (R) (mandatory)
                          (4 bytes)
Internal MAC receive      This attribute counts frames whose reception failed due to an internal
error counter:            MAC sublayer receive error. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
