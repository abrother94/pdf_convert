9.7.22 xDSL xTU-R performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data of the xTU-C to xTU-R path as seen
from the xTU-R. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a physical path termination
point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                              linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                              UNI. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:            This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                              (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:        This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                              entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                              attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loss of frame seconds:        (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loss of signal seconds:       (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loss of power seconds:        (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Errored seconds:              This attribute counts one-second intervals with one or more FEBE
                              anomalies summed over all transmitted bearer channels, or one or
                              more LOS-FE defects, or one or more RDI defects, or one or more
                              LPR-FE defects. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Severely errored seconds:     This attribute counts severely errored seconds (SES-LFE). An SES is
                              declared if, during a one-second interval, 18 or more FEBE
                              anomalies were reported across the totality of bearer channels, or
                              there were one or more far-end LOS defects, or one or more RDI
                              defects, or one or more LPR-FE defects.
                              If the relevant Recommendation ([ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.5],
                              [ITU-T G.993.2]) supports a one-second normalized CRC-8 anomaly
                              counter increment, the one-second SES counter follows this value
                              instead of counting FEBE anomalies directly.
                                If a CRC is applied for multiple bearer channels, then each related
                                FEBE anomaly is counted only once for the whole set of related
                                bearer channels.
                                (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
FEC seconds:                    This attribute counts seconds during which there was a forward error
                                correction anomaly. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Unavailable seconds:            This attribute counts one-second intervals during which the far-end
                                xDSL line is unavailable.
                                The far-end xDSL line becomes unavailable at the onset of
                                10 contiguous SES-LFEs. The 10 SES-LFEs are included in
                                unavailable time. Once unavailable, the far-end line becomes
                                available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no SES-LFEs.
                                The 10 seconds with no SES-LFEs are excluded from unavailable
                                time. Some attribute counts are inhibited during unavailability – see
                                clause 7.2.7.13 of [ITU-T G.997.1].
