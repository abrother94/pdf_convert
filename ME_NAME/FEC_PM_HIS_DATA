9.2.11 FEC performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data associated with FEC counters. Instances
of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the ANI-G managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                  entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                  linked to an instance of the ANI-G. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                                  (2 bytes)
Interval end time:                This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute
                                  interval. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:            This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                                  entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                                  attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R,
                                  W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Corrected bytes:                  This attribute counts the number of bytes that were corrected by the
                                  FEC function. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Corrected code words:             This attribute counts the code words that were corrected by the
                                  FEC function. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Uncorrectable code words:         This attribute counts the code words that were not corrected by the
                                  FEC function. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Total code words:                 This attribute counts the total received code words. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
FEC seconds:                      This attribute counts seconds during which there was a forward
                                  error correction anomaly. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
