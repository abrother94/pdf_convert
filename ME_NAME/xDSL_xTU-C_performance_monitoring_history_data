9.7.21 xDSL xTU-C performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data on the xTU-C to xTU-R path as seen
from the xTU-C. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a physical path termination
point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                               entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                               linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                               UNI. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:             This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                               (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:         This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2
                               managed entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W,
                               Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loss of frame seconds:         (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loss of signal seconds:        (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loss of link seconds:          (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loss of power seconds:         (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Errored seconds:               This attribute counts one-second intervals with one or more CRC-8
                               anomalies summed over all received bearer channels, or one or more
                               LOS defects, or one or more SEF defects, or one or more LPR
                               defects. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Severely errored seconds:      This attribute counts severely errored seconds (SES-L). An SES is
                               declared if, during a one-second interval, there were 18 or more
                               CRC-8 anomalies in one or more of the received bearer channels, or
                               one or more LOS defects, or one or more SEF defects, or one or
                               more LPR defects.
                               If the relevant Recommendation ([ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.5],
                               [ITU-T G.993.2]) supports a one-second normalized CRC-8 anomaly
                               counter increment, the one-second SES counter follows this value
                               instead of counting CRC-8 anomalies directly.
                               If a common CRC is applied over multiple bearer channels, then each
                               related CRC-8 anomaly is counted only once for the whole set of
                               bearer channels over which the CRC is applied.
                               (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Line initializations:          This attribute counts the total number of full initializations attempted
                               on the line, both successful and failed. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                                  during the accumulation period. A failed full initialization occurs
                                  when showtime is not reached at the end of the full initialization
                                  procedure. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Short initializations:            This attribute counts the total number of fast retrains or short
                                  initializations attempted on the line, successful and failed. Fast
                                  retrain is defined in [b-ITU-T G.992.2]. Short initialization is defined
                                  in [ITU-T G.992.3] and [ITU-T G.992.4]. (R) (optional) (2 bytes)
Failed short initializations: This attribute counts the total number of failed fast retrains or short
                                  initializations during the accumulation period, e.g., when:
                                  – A CRC error is detected.
                                  – A timeout occurs.
                                  – A fast retrain profile is unknown.
                                  (R) (optional) (2 bytes)
FEC seconds:                      This attribute counts seconds during which there was a forward error
                                  correction anomaly. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Unavailable seconds:              This attribute counts one-second intervals during which the xDSL
                                  line is unavailable. The line becomes unavailable at the onset of
                                  10 contiguous SES-Ls. The 10 SES-Ls are included in unavailable
                                  time. Once unavailable, the line becomes available at the onset of
                                  10 contiguous seconds that are not severely errored. The 10 seconds
                                  with no SES-Ls are excluded from unavailable time. Some attribute
                                  counts are inhibited during unavailability – see clause 7.2.7.13 of
                                  [ITU-T G.997.1]. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
