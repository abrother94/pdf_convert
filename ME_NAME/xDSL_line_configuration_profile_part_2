9.7.4    xDSL line configuration profile part 2
The overall xDSL line configuration profile is modelled in several parts, all of which are associated
together through a common managed entity id (the client physical path termination point xDSL UNI
part 1 has a single pointer, which refers to the entire set of line configuration profile parts).
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                            entity. All xDSL and VDSL2 line configuration profiles that
                            pertain to a given physical path termination point xDSL must
                            share a common managed entity id. (R, Set-by-create)

Upstream maximum                This parameter specifies the maximum upstream aggregate receive
aggregate receive power:        power over a set of subcarriers, as defined in the relevant
                                Recommendation. The xTU-C requests an upstream power

                                set of subcarriers is at or below the configured maximum value. It

                                (+25.5 dBm). The special value 0xFFFF indicates that no
                                upstream maximum aggregate receive power limit is to be applied.
