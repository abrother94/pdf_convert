9.2.6    GEM port performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data associated with a GEM port network
CTP. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the GEM port network CTP
managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:           This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                             Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                             instance of the GEM port network CTP. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                             (2 bytes)
Interval end time:           This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                             (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:       This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                             entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                             attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                             Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Lost packets:                This attribute counts background GEM frame loss. It does not
                             distinguish between packets lost because of header bit errors or buffer
                             overflows; it records only loss of information. (R) (mandatory)
                             (4 bytes)
Misinserted packets:         This attribute counts GEM frames misrouted to this GEM port. (R)
                             (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Received packets:            This attribute counts GEM frames that were received correctly at the
                             monitored GEM port. (R) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
Received blocks:             This attribute counts GEM blocks that were received correctly at the
                             monitored GEM port. (R) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
Transmitted blocks:          This attribute counts GEM blocks originated by the transmitting end
                             point (i.e., backward reporting is assumed). (R) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
Impaired blocks:             This severely errored data block counter is incremented whenever one
                             of the following events takes place: the number of misinserted packets
                             reaches its threshold, the number of bipolar violations reaches its
                             threshold, or the number of lost packets reaches its threshold.
                             Threshold values are based on vendor-operator negotiation. (R)
                             (mandatory) (4 bytes)

 managed entity.
