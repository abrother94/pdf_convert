9.9.12 Call control performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data related to the call control channel.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the PPTP POTS UNI managed
entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                          instance of the PPTP POTS UNI. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                          (2 bytes)
Interval end time:        This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval. (R)
                          (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:    This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed entity
                          that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value attribute
                          number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                          Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Call setup failures:      This attribute counts call setup failures. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Call setup timer:         This attribute is a high water mark that records the longest duration of a
                          single call setup detected during this interval. Time is measured in
                          milliseconds from the time an initial setup was requested by the
                          subscriber until the time at which a response was provided to the
                          subscriber in the form of busy tone, audible ring tone, etc. (R)
                          (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Call terminate failures:  This attribute counts the number of calls that were terminated with cause.
                          (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Analog port releases:     This attribute counts the number of analogue port releases without
                          dialling detected (abandoned calls). (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Analog port off-hook      This attribute is a high water mark that records the longest period of a
timer:                    single off-hook detected on the analogue port. Time is measured in
                          milliseconds. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Actions
Create, delete, get, set
Get current data (optional)

 NOTE â€“ This number associates the TCA with the specified threshold value attribute of the threshold
 data 1 managed entity.
