9.4.13 IP host performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data related to an IP host. Instances of this
managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the IP host managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                            instance of the IP host configuration data ME. (R, Set-by-create)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:          This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                            (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:      This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                            entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                            attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                            Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ICMP errors:                This attribute counts ICMP errors received. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
DNS errors:                 This attribute counts DNS errors received. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Create, delete, get, set
Get current data (optional)

 NOTE â€“ This number associates the TCA with the specified threshold value attribute of the threshold
 data 1 managed entity.
