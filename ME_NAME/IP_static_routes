9.4.5    IP static routes
This managed entity stores IP static routes. The ONT automatically creates or deletes an instance of
this managed entity upon creation or deletion of an instance of the IP router service profile.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the IP router service profile.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                          instance of the IP router service profile. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Ip static route table     This attribute indicates the maximum number of routes that can be stored
max size:                 in the static route table. Its value is determined by the ONT
                          implementation. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Ip static route table:    This attribute stores static routes. A route contains several fields, defined
                          below.
                          route id:             A unique identifier of a route within the static route
                                                table. (1 byte)
                          action:               Remove (0) or add (1) this route, meaningful during
                                                the set action only. When a static route is being
                                                removed, the route is identified by the route id field.
                                                (1 byte)
                          destination           The IP destination address of this route. This field
                          address:              may be set to the default route address 0.0.0.0.
                                                (4 bytes)
                          destination           The address mask associated with the destination
                          address mask:         address. (4 bytes)
                          next hop:             The address of the next router on remote routes. This
                                                field is not used when the next hop is reached
                                                through an unnumbered link. (4 bytes, 0xFFFF FFFF
                                                when not used)
                                                hop should be reached. This field is used when the
                                                next hop is reached through an unnumbered link and
                                                when a static route is set to support a fully meshed
                                                network. (1 byte, 0xFF when not used)
                          iw pointer:           Pointer to the instance of the GEM interworking
                                                termination point that identifies a link of a fully
                                                meshed network being set by this attribute. The
                                                value 0 is a null pointer. (2 bytes)
                          metric:               The routing metric for this route. (4 bytes)
                          (R, W) (mandatory) (21N bytes, where N is the number of routes)
