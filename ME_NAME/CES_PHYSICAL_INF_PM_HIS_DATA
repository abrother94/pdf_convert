9.8.4    CES physical interface performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects statistics for a CES physical interface. Interfaces include DS1, DS3,
E1, E3, J1, J2 and possibly others. The performance management requirements of particular
interfaces are described in the corresponding ITU-T or other standard document, e.g.,
[ITU-T G.784].
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with one instance of the physical path termination
point CES UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                              linked to an instance of the physical path termination point CES UNI.
                              (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:            This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                              (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:        This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                              entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                              attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Errored seconds:              (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Severely errored seconds:       (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Burst errored seconds:          A burst errored second is any second that is not a UAS, that contains
                                between 2 and 319 error events but no LOS, AIS or OOF condition.
                                (R) (optional) (2 bytes)
Unavailable seconds:            (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Controlled slip seconds:        (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Actions
Create, delete, get, set
Get current data (optional)
