9.9.1   Physical path termination point POTS UNI
This managed entity represents the point at a POTS UNI in the ONT where a physical path
terminates and physical path level functions (analogue telephony) are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•       When the ONT has POTS ports built into its factory configuration.
•       When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of POTS type.
•       When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of POTS
        type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of POTS
        ports via equipment ID as well as type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a port
        mapping package that specifies POTS ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a POTS circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a POTS circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each real or preprovisioned POTS port. SIP
and VoIP voice CTPs may link to the POTS UNI, which in turn points to a GEM interworking TP.
Status is available from a VoIP line status ME, and RTP and call control PM may be collected on
this point.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the
                              UNI. The first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). If the UNI
                              is integrated, this value is 0. The second byte is the port ID, with
                              range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Administrative state:         This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by
                              this managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all
                              user functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs
                              for this managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no
                              longer generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is
                              outside the scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory)
                              (1 byte)
Interworking TP pointer:      This attribute points to the associated instance of the GEM
                              interworking termination point managed entity. The value 0 is a null
                              pointer. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
ARC:                          See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:                 See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Impedance:                    This attribute specifies the impedance for the POTS UNI. Valid
                              values include:
                              0   600 Ohms.
                              1   900 Ohms.
                              The following parameter sets from Annex C of [ETSI TS 101 270-1]
                              are also defined:
                              2   C1=150 nF, R1=750 Ohm, R2=270 Ohm.
                              3   C1=115 nF, R1=820 Ohm, R2=220 Ohm.
                              4   C1=230 nF, R1=1050 Ohm, R2=320 Ohm.
                              Where C1, R1, and R2 are related as shown in Figure 9.9.1-1. Upon
                              ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W) (optional)
                              (1 byte)
                                            C1
                                                           R2
                                            R1

Transmission path:            This attribute allows setting the POTS UNI either to full-time
                              on-hook transmission (0) or part-time on-hook transmission (1).
                              Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                              (optional) (1 byte)
Rx gain:                      This attribute specifies a gain value for the received signal in the
                              form of a 2s complement number. Valid values are –120 (–12.0 dB)
                              to 60 (+6.0 dB). Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to
                              0. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Tx gain:                      This attribute specifies a gain value for the transmit signal in the form
                              of a 2s complement number. Valid values are –120 (–12.0 dB) to 60
                              (+6.0 dB). Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0.
                              (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Operational state:            This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable
                              of performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled
                              (1). (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Hook state:                   This attribute indicates the current state of the subscriber line: 0 = on
                              hook, 1 = off hook. (R) (Optional) (1 byte)
POTS holdover time:           This attribute determines the time during which POTS loop voltage is
                              held up when the ONT is not ranged on the PON. After the specified
                              time elapses, the ONT drops loop voltage, and may thereby cause
                              premises intrusion alarm circuits to go active. When the ONT ranges
                              successfully on the PON, it restores POTS loop voltage immediately
                              and resets the timer to zero. The attribute is expressed in seconds.
                              The default value 0 selects the vendor's factory policy. (R, W)
                              (optional) (2 bytes)
