9.13.9 VP network CTP-G
This managed entity represents the termination of VP links on an ONT. It aggregates connectivity
functionality from the network view and alarms from the network element view as well as artefacts
from trails. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
An instance of the VP network CTP-G managed entity can be deleted only when no ATM
interworking VCC termination point is associated with it. It is the responsibility of the OLT to
ensure that this condition is met.
Relationships
Zero or more instances of the VP network CTP-G managed entity may exist for each instance of the
interworking VCC termination point managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                entity. It must be unique over all GEM port network CTP and VP
                                network CTP-G MEs. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
VPI value:                      This attribute identifies the VPI value associated with the VP link
                                being terminated. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
UNI pointer:                    This pointer indicates the xDSL physical path termination point UNI
                                associated with this VP termination point. The bearer channel may
                                be indicated by the two most significant bits of the pointer. (R, W,
                                Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Direction:                      This attribute specifies whether the VP link is used for UNI-to-ANI
                                (value 1), ANI-to-UNI (value 02), or bidirectional (value 3)
                                connection. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Priority queue pointer          Not used, should be set to 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
for downstream:                 (2 bytes)
Traffic management              Not used, should be set to 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
pointer for upstream:           (2 bytes)
Traffic descriptor profile      Not used, should be set to 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional)
pointer:                        (2 bytes)
UNI counter:                    Not used, should be set to 0. (R) (optional) (1 byte)

      4      Segment loss of            Loss of continuity is detected when the VP network CTP-G is a
             continuity                 segment end point (optional)
      5      End-to-end loss of         Loss of continuity can be detected when the VP network CTP-G
             continuity                 supports an interworking VCC termination point (optional)
