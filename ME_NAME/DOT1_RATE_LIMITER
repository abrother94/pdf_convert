9.3.18 Dot1 rate limiter
This managed entity allows rate limits to be defined for various types of upstream traffic that are
processed by 802.1 bridges or related structures.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be linked to an instance of the MAC bridge service profile,
an 802.1p mapper or other managed entities.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                               (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Parent ME pointer:             This attribute points to an instance of a managed entity. The type of
                               managed entity is determined by the TP type attribute. (R, W,
                               Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
TP type:                       This attribute identifies the type of termination point associated with
                               this dot1 rate limiter. Valid values are:
                               1   MAC bridge configuration data.
                               2   802.1p mapper service profile.
                               (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Upstream unicast flood         This attribute points to an instance of the GEM traffic descriptor that
rate pointer:                  specifies the maximum rate of upstream unicast packets whose
                               destination address is unknown to the bridge. A null pointer specifies
                               that no administrative limit is to be imposed. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                               (optional) (2 bytes)
Upstream broadcast rate        This attribute points to an instance of the GEM traffic descriptor that
pointer:                       specifies the maximum rate of upstream broadcast packets. A null
                               pointer specifies that no administrative limit is to be imposed. (R, W,
                               Set-by-create) (optional) (2 bytes)
Upstream multicast             This attribute points to an instance of the GEM traffic descriptor that
payload rate pointer:          specifies the maximum rate of upstream multicast payload packets. A
                               null pointer specifies that no administrative limit is to be imposed.
                               (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (2 bytes)
