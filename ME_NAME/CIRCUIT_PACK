9.1.6    Circuit pack
This managed entity models a circuit pack that is equipped in an ONT slot. For ONTs with
integrated interfaces, this managed entity may be used to distinguish available types of interfaces
(the port mapping package is another way).
For ONTs with integrated interfaces, the ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed
entity for each instance of the virtual cardholder managed entity. The ONT also creates an instance
of this managed entity when the OLT provisions the cardholder to expect a circuit pack (i.e., when
the OLT sets the expected plug-in unit type or equipment ID of the cardholder to a circuit pack
type, as defined in clause 9.1.5). The ONT also creates an instance of this managed entity when a
circuit pack is installed in a cardholder whose expected plug-in unit type is 255 = plug-and-play,
and whose equipment ID is not provisioned. Finally, when the cardholder is provisioned for
plug-and-play, an instance of this managed entity can be created at the request of the OLT.
The ONT deletes an instance of this managed entity when the OLT de-provisions the circuit pack
(i.e., when the OLT sets the expected plug-in unit type or equipment ID of the cardholder to 0 = no
LIM). The ONT also deletes an instance of this managed entity on request of the OLT if the
expected plug-in unit type attribute of the corresponding cardholder is equal to 255, plug-and-play,
and the expected equipment ID is blank (a string of all spaces). ONTs with integrated interfaces do
not delete circuit pack instances.
NOTE â€“ Creation and deletion by the OLT is retained for backward compatibility.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is contained by an instance of the cardholder managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:     This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. Its
                       value is the same as that of the cardholder managed entity containing this
                       circuit pack instance. (R, Set-by-create (if applicable)) (mandatory)
                       (22 bytes)
Type:                  This attribute identifies the circuit pack type. This attribute is a code as
                       defined in Table 9.1.5-1. The value 255 means unknown or undefined, i.e.,
                       the inserted circuit pack is not recognized by the ONT or is not mapped to
                       an entry in Table 9.1.5-1. In the latter case, the equipment ID attribute may
                       contain inventory information. Upon autonomous ME instantiation, the
                       ONT sets this attribute to 0 or to the type of the circuit pack that is
                       physically present. (R, Set-by-create (if applicable)) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Number of ports:       This attribute is the number of access ports on the circuit pack. If the port
                       mapping package-G is supported for this circuit pack, this attribute should
                       be set to the total number of ports of all types. (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Serial number:         The serial number is unique for each circuit pack. Note that the serial
                       number may contain the vendor ID and/or version number. For integrated
                       ONTs, this value is identical to the value of the serial number attribute of
                       the ONT-G managed entity. Upon creation in the absence of a physical
                       circuit pack, this attribute comprises all spaces. (R) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
Version:               This attribute is a string that identifies the version of the circuit pack as
                       defined by the vendor. The value 0 indicates that version information is not
                       available or applicable. For integrated ONTs, this value is identical to the
                       value of the version attribute of the ONT-G managed entity. Upon creation
                       in the absence of a physical circuit pack, this attribute comprises all spaces.
                       (R) (mandatory) (14 bytes)
Vendor id:             This attribute identifies the vendor of the circuit pack. For ONTs with
                       integrated interfaces, this value is identical to the value of the vendor ID
                       attribute of the ONT-G managed entity. Upon creation in the absence of a
                       physical circuit pack, this attribute comprises all spaces. (R) (optional)
                       (4 bytes)
Administrative state:  This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by the
                       circuit pack. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user functions
                       of this circuit pack are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this
                       managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer generated.
                       Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the scope of this
                       Recommendation. (R, W, Set-by-create (if applicable)) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:     This attribute indicates whether or not the circuit pack is capable of
                       performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0), disabled (1) and
                       unknown (2). Pending completion of initialization and self test on an
                       installed circuit pack, the ONT sets this attribute to 2. (R) (optional) (1 byte)
                     from an IP router function.
                     0        Bridged.
                     1        IP router.
                     2        Both bridged and IP router functions.
                     (R, W) (optional, only applicable for circuit packs with Ethernet interfaces)
                     (1 byte)
Equipment id:        This attribute may be used to identify the vendor's specific type of circuit
                     pack. In North America, this may be the CLEI code. Upon ME instantiation,
                     the ONT sets this attribute to all spaces or to the equipment ID of the circuit
                     pack that is physically present. (R) (optional) (20 bytes)
Card configuration:  This attribute selects the appropriate configuration on configurable circuit
                     packs (e.g., T1/E1). Table 9.1.5-1 specifies three configurable card types:
                     A45/34 (code 9), C-DS1/E1 (code 16), and C-DS1/E1/J1 (code 17). Values
                     are indicated below for the allowed card types and configurations.
                     Card type            Configuration                Value
                     A45/34            ATM 44.736 Mbit/s                  0
                                       ATM 34.368 Mbit/s                  1
                     C-DS1/E1               DS1                           0
                                             E1                           1
                     C-DS1/E1/J1            DS1                           0
                                             E1                           1
                                             J1                           2
                     Upon autonomous instantiation, this attribute is set to 0. (R, W,
                     Set-by-create (if applicable)) (mandatory for configurable circuit packs)
                     (1 byte)
Total T-CONT buffer  This attribute reports the total number of T-CONT buffers associated with
number:              the circuit pack. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0 or
                     to the value supported by the physical circuit pack. (R) (mandatory for
                     circuit packs that provide a traffic scheduler function) (1 byte)
Total priority queue  This value reports the total number of priority queues associated with the
number:              circuit pack. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets the attribute to 0 or to the
                     value supported by the physical circuit pack. (R) (mandatory for circuit
                     packs that provide a traffic scheduler function) (1 byte)
Total traffic        This value reports the total number of traffic schedulers associated with the
scheduler number:    circuit pack. The ONT supports null function, HOL (head of line)
                     scheduling and WRR (weighted round robin) from the priority control and
                     guarantee of minimum rate control points of view, respectively. If the
                     circuit pack has no traffic scheduler, this attribute should be 0. Upon ME
                     instantiation, the ONT sets the attribute to 0 or to the value supported by the
                     physical circuit pack. (R) (mandatory for circuit packs that provide a traffic
                     scheduler function) (1 byte)
                            defined in clause 9.1.7. It is a bit mask that takes port 1 as the MSB; a bit
                            value of 1 marks the corresponding port to override the power shed timer.
                            For hardware that cannot shed power per port, this attribute is a slot override
                            rather than a port override, with any non-zero port value causing the entire
                            circuit pack to override power shedding. (R, W) (optional) (4 bytes)
