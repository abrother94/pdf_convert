9.4.12 IP host config data
The IP host config data configures IP-based services offered on the ONT. The ONT automatically
creates instances of this managed entity if IP host services are available.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with the ONT managed entity. Any number of
TCP/UDP MEs can point to the IP host config data, to model any number of ports and protocols.
Performance may be monitored through an implicitly linked IP host PM history data ME.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            The ONT creates as many instances as there are independent IP stacks
                            on the ONT. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                         value 1 enables the option while 0 disables it.
                         0x1           Enable DHCP.
                         0x2           Respond to pings.
                         0x4           Respond to traceroute messages.
                         0x8..0x80 Reserved.
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
MAC address:             This attribute indicates the MAC address used by the IP node. (R)
                         (mandatory) (6 bytes)
Ont identifier:          A unique ONT identifier string. If set to a non-null value, this string is
                         used instead of the MAC address in retrieving DHCP parameters. If the
                         string is shorter than 25 characters, it must be null terminated. Its default
                         value is 25 null bytes. (R, W) (mandatory) (25 bytes)
IP address:              The address used for IP host services, this attribute has default value 0
                         (not set). If this value is set, it overrides any values returned in DHCP.
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Mask:                    The subnet mask for IP host services, this attribute has default value 0
                         (not set). If this value is set, it overrides any values returned in DHCP.
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Gateway:                 The default gateway address used for IP host services, this attribute has
                         default value 0 (not set). If this value is set, it overrides any values
                         returned in DHCP. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Primary DNS:             The address of the primary DNS server, this attribute has default value 0
                         (not set). If this value is set, it overrides any values returned in DHCP.
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Secondary DNS:           The address of the secondary DNS server, this attribute has default value
                         0 (not set). If this value is set, it overrides any values returned in DHCP.
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Current address:         Current address of the IP host service. The ONT updates this attribute if
                         DHCP assigns a new address. (R) (optional) (4 bytes)
Current mask:            Current subnet mask for the IP host service. The ONT updates this
                         attribute if DHCP assigns a new mask. (R) (optional) (4 bytes)
Current gateway:         Current default gateway address for the IP host service. The ONT
                         updates this attribute if DHCP assigns a new gateway. (R) (optional)
                         (4 bytes)
Current primary DNS:     Current primary DNS server address. The ONT updates this attribute if
                         DHCP assigns a new address. (R) (optional) (4 bytes)
Current secondary DNS:  Current secondary DNS server address. The ONT updates this attribute
                         if DHCP assigns a new address. (R) (optional) (4 bytes)
Domain name:             If DHCP indicates a domain name, it is presented here. If no domain
                         name is indicated, this attribute is set to a null string. If the string is
                         shorter than 25 bytes, it must be null terminated. The default value is
                         25 null bytes. (R) (mandatory) (25 bytes)
                            indicated, this attribute is set to a null string. If the string is shorter than
                            25 bytes, it must be null terminated. The default value is 25 null bytes.
                            (R) (mandatory) (25 bytes)
Actions
Get, set
Test:                       Invoke an ICMP message from this IP host. The test message can be
                            configured to generate a ping or traceroute. Appendix II defines the test,
                            test response and test result messages.
