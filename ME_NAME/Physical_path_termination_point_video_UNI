9.13.1 Physical path termination point video UNI
This managed entity represents an RF video UNI in the ONT, where physical paths terminate and
physical path level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•        When the ONT has RF video UNI ports built into its factory configuration.
•        When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of video UNI type.
•        When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of video
         UNI type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of
         video ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to
         instantiate a port mapping package that specifies video ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a video circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a video circuit pack.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a real or virtual
circuit pack classified as video type.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the UNI. The first
                          byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte is the port ID,
                          with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Administrative            This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
state:                    managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                          functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this
                          managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer
                          generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the scope
                          of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:        This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable of
                          performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1). (R)
                          (optional) (1 byte)
ARC:                      See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:             See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Power control:            This attribute controls whether power is provided to an external equipment
                          over the video PPTP. Value 1 enables power over coaxial cable. The
                          default value 0 disables power feed. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
