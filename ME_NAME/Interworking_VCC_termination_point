9.13.4 Interworking VCC termination point
An instance of this managed entity represents a point in the ONT where the interworking of a
service or underlying physical infrastructure (e.g., ADSL) to an ATM layer takes place. At this
point, ATM cells are generated from a bit stream (e.g., Ethernet) or a bit stream is re-constructed
from ATM cells.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity exists for each occurrence of transformation of a data stream
into ATM cells and vice versa.
Attributes
Managed entity id:     This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. It
                       must be unique over all interworking VCC and GEM interworking
                       termination point MEs. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
VCI value:             This attribute identifies the VCI value associated with this interworking
                       VCC termination point. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
VP network CTP         This attribute points to the VP network CTP associated with this
connectivity           interworking VCC termination point. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
pointer:               (2 bytes)
Interworking           Not used, should be set to 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
option:
Service profile        Not used, should be set to 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
pointer:
AAL5 profile           This attribute points to an instance of the AAL5 profile. (R, W,
pointer:               Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interworking           Not used, should be set to 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)

configuration:           retained for backward compatibility, but some are not expected to be
                         needed in G-PON applications.
                         0   No loopback.
                         1   Loopback 1, loopback of downstream traffic before FEC of AAL 1.
                         2   Loopback 2, loopback of downstream traffic after FEC of AAL 1.
                         3   Loopback after AAL, loopback of downstream traffic after any AAL.
                             Loopback after AAL is depicted in Figure 9.13.4-1.

                         The default value of this attribute is 0. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
PPTP counter:            This value is the number of instances of PPTP managed entities associated
                         with this instance of the interworking VCC termination point. (R)
                         (optional) (1 byte)
Operational state:       This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable of
                         performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1). (R)
                         (optional) (1 byte)
