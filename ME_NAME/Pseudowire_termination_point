9.8.5    Pseudowire termination point
The pseudowire termination point supports packetized (rather than TDM) G-PON transport of TDM
services, transported either directly over Ethernet or over UDP/IP. Instances of this managed entity
are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
One pseudowire termination point ME exists for each distinct TDM service that is mapped to a
pseudowire.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Underlying transport:           0    Ethernet, MEF8.
                                1    UDP/IP.
                                (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Service type:                   This attribute specifies the basic service type, either a transparent bit
                                pipe or an encapsulation that recognizes the underlying structure of
                                the payload.
                                0 Basic unstructured (also known as structure agnostic).
                                1 Octet-aligned unstructured, structure agnostic. Applicable only to
                                    DS1, a mode in which each frame of 193 bits is encapsulated in
                                    25 bytes with 7 padding bits.
                                2 Structured (structure-locked).
                                (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Signalling:           0    No signalling visible at this layer.
                      1    CAS, to be carried in the same packet stream as the payload.
                      2    CAS, to be carried in a separate signalling channel.
                      (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory for structured service type) (1 byte)
TDM UNI pointer:      If service type = structured, this attribute points to a logical
                      N x 64 kbit/s sub-port connection termination point. Otherwise, this
                      attribute points to a physical path termination point CES UNI. (R, W,
                      Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Near-end IP info:     When the pseudowire service is transported via IP, this attribute
                      points to an instance of the TCP/UDP config data managed entity.
                      The default value 0 is applicable if the pseudowire is not transported
                      via IP. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory for IP transport) (2 bytes)
Far-end IP info:      When the pseudowire service is transported via IP, this attribute
                      points to a large string managed entity that contains the URI of the
                      far-end termination point, for example:
                         udp://192.168.100.221:5000 or
                         udp://pwe3srvr.int.example.net:2222
                      The default value 0 is applicable if the pseudowire is not transported
                      via IP. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory for IP transport) (2 bytes)
Payload size:         Number of payload bytes per packet. Valid only if service type =
                      unstructured or unstructured octet-aligned. Valid choices depend on
                      the TDM service, but must include the following. Other choices are
                      at the vendor's discretion.
                            DS1    192.
                            DS1    200, required only if unstructured octet-aligned service is
                                   supported.
                            E1     256.
                            DS3    1024.
                            E3     1024.
                      (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory for unstructured service) (2 bytes)
Payload encapsulation Number of 125 microsecond frames to be encapsulated in each
delay:                pseudowire packet. Valid only if service type = structured. The
                      minimum set of choices for various TDM services is listed below,
                      and is affected by the possible presence of in-band signalling. Other
                      choices are at the vendor's discretion.
                            NxDS0, no signalling, N = 1         64 (8 ms) required,
                                                                40 (5 ms) desired.
                            NxDS0, no signalling, N = 2..4 32 (4 ms).
                            NxDS0, no signalling, N > 4         8 (1 ms).
                            NxDS0 with DS1 CAS                  24 (3 ms).
                            NxDS0 with E1 CAS                   16 (2 ms).
                      (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory for structured service) (1 byte)
                             used, this attribute must be set to be consistent with the value of the
                             RTP time stamp mode attribute in the RTP parameters managed
                             entity at the far end.
                             0        Network timing (default).
                             1        Differential timing.
                             2        Adaptive timing.
                             3        Loop timing:  local TDM transmit clock derived from local
                                      TDM receive stream.
                             (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Transmit circuit ID:         This attribute is a pair of ECID (Ethernet circuit ID) values that the
                             ONT transmits in the direction from the TDM termination toward the
                             packet-switched network. MEF8 ECIDs lie in the range 1..1048575
                             (220 – 1). To allow for the possibility of other transport (L2TP) in the
                             future, each ECID is allocated 4 bytes.
                             The first value is used for the payload ECID; the second is used for
                             the optional separate signalling ECID. The first ECID is required for
                             all MEF8 pseudowires; the second is required only if signalling is to
                             be carried in a distinct channel. If signalling is not present, or is
                             carried in the same channel as the payload, the second ECID should
                             be set to 0.
                             (R, W) (mandatory for MEF8 transport) (8 bytes)
Expected circuit ID:         This attribute is a pair of ECID (Ethernet circuit ID) values that the
                             ONT can expect in the direction from the packet-switched network
                             toward the TDM termination. Checking ECIDs may be a way to
                             detect circuit misconnection. MEF8 ECIDs lie in the range
                             1..1048575 (220 – 1). To allow for the possibility of other transport
                             (L2TP) in the future, each ECID is allocated 4 bytes.
                             The first value is used for the payload ECID; the second is used for
                             the optional separate signalling ECID. In both cases, the default value
                             0 indicates that no ECID checking is expected.
                             (R, W) (optional for MEF8 transport) (8 bytes)
Received circuit ID:         This attribute indicates the actual ECID(s) received on the payload
                             and signalling channels, respectively. It may be used for diagnostic
                             purposes. (R) (optional for MEF8 transport) (8 bytes)
Exception policy:            This attribute points to an instance of the pseudowire maintenance
                             profile managed entity. If the pointer has its default value 0, the
                             ONT's internal defaults apply. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
ARC:                         See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:                See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
