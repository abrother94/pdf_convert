9.10.1 Physical path termination point MoCA UNI
This managed entity represents a MoCA UNI, where physical paths terminate and physical path
level functions (i.e., the MoCA function) are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•        When the ONT has MoCA ports built into its factory configuration.
•        When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of MoCA type.
•        When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of MoCA
         type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of MoCA
         ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
         port mapping package that specifies MoCA ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a MoCA circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a MoCA circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each real or preprovisioned MoCA port.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. This
                         two-byte number is directly associated with the physical position of the
                         UNI. The first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte
                         is the port ID, with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Loopback configuration: This attribute sets the MoCA loopback configuration:
                         0    No loopback.
                         3    Loopback3, loopback of downstream traffic after PHY transceiver,
                              depicted in Figure 9.10.1-1.
                         Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W) (optional)
                         (1 byte)
                      Figure 9.10.1-1 – MoCA loopback configuration
Note that normal bridge behaviour may defeat the loopback signal, unless broadcast MAC
addresses are used.
Administrative state:   This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
                        managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                        functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this
                        managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer
                        generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the
                        scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Operational state:      This attribute indicates whether or not the managed entity is capable of
                        performing its function. Valid values are enabled (0) and disabled (1).
                        (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Max frame size:         This attribute denotes the maximum frame size allowed across this
                        interface. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 1518.
                        (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ARC:                    See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:           See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
PPPoE filter:           This attribute controls filtering of PPPoE packets on this MoCA port.
                        When its value is 1, all packets other than PPPoE packets are discarded.
                        The default 0 accepts packets of all types. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Network status:         This attribute indicates the networking state of the MoCA interface.
                        0    The interface has not joined a MoCA network.
                        1    The interface has joined a MoCA network.
                        2    The interface has joined a MoCA network and is currently the
                             network coordinator.
                        (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Password:                    This attribute specifies the MoCA encryption key. It is an ASCII string
                             of 17 decimal digits. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute
                             to 17 null bytes. (R, W) (mandatory) (17 bytes)
Privacy enabled:             This attribute activates (1) link-layer security. The default value 0
                             deactivates it. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Minimum bandwidth            This attribute specifies the minimum desired PHY link bandwidth
alarm threshold:             between two nodes. If the actual bandwidth is lower, a limited link alarm
                             is declared. Valid values are 0 to 0x0410 (260 Mbit/s) in 0.25-Mbit/s
                             increments. The default value is 0x02D0 (180 Mbit/s). The value 0
                             disables the threshold. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
Frequency mask:              This attribute is a bit map of the centre frequencies that the interface is
                             permitted to use, where each bit represents a centre frequency. The least
                             significant bit (b[1]) corresponds to centre frequency 800 MHz. The next
                             significant bit (b[2]) corresponds to centre frequency 825 MHz. The
                             28th bit (b[28]) corresponds to a centre frequency 1500 MHz. The
                             4 most significant bits are not used. (R, W) (optional) (4 bytes)
RF channel:                  This attribute reports the frequency to which the MoCA interface is
                             currently tuned, in MHz. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Last operational             This attribute reports the frequency to which the MoCA interface was
frequency:                   tuned when last operational, in MHz. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
