9.9.13 RTP performance monitoring history data
NOTE – This managed entity was formerly known under the name RTP monitoring data.
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data related to an RTP session. Instances of
this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the PPTP POTS UNI managed
entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                           instance of the PPTP POTS UNI ME. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                           (2 bytes)
Interval end time:         This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                           (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:     This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed entity
                           that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value attribute
                           number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                           Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
RTP errors:                This attribute counts RTP packet errors. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Packet loss:               This attribute represents the fraction of packets lost. This attribute is
                           calculated at the end of the 15-minute interval, and is undefined under
                           the get current data action. The value 0 indicates no packet loss, scaling
                           linearly to 0xFFFF to indicate 100% packet loss (zero divided by zero is
                           defined to be zero). (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Maximum jitter:            This attribute is a high water mark that represents the maximum jitter
                           identified during the measured interval, expressed in RTP timestamp
                           units. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Maximum time between This attribute is a high water mark that represents the maximum time
RTCP packets:              between RTCP packets during the measured interval, in milliseconds.
                           (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Buffer underflows:         This attribute counts the number of times the reassembly buffer
                           underflows. In case of continuous underflow caused by a loss of IP
                           packets, a single buffer underflow should be counted. If the interworking
                           function is implemented with multiple buffers, such as a packet level
                           buffer and a bit level buffer, then underflow of either buffer increments
                           this counter. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Buffer overflows:          This attribute counts the number of times the reassembly buffer
                           overflows. If the interworking function is implemented with multiple
                           buffers, such as a packet level buffer and a bit level buffer, then overflow
                           of either buffer increments this counter. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)

 NOTE 1 – Since packet loss is undefined until the end of the interval, this TCA may only be issued at the
 interval boundary, whereupon it is then immediately cleared.
 NOTE 2 – This number associates the TCA with the specified threshold value attribute of the threshold
 data 1 managed entity.
