9.9.16 MGC config data
The MGC config data ME defines the media gateway controller configuration associated with an
MG subscriber. It is conditionally required for ONTs that support H.248 VoIP service. If a
non-OMCI interface is used to manage VoIP signalling, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI
interface supplies the necessary data, which may be read back to the OLT via the MGC config
portal ME.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with one or more VoIP voice CTP managed
entities.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Primary MGC:              This attribute points to a network address ME that contains the name (IP
                          address or resolved name) of the primary MGC that controls the
                          signalling messages. The port is optional and defaults to 2944 for text
                          message formats and 2955 for binary message formats. (R, W,
                          Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Secondary MGC:            This attribute points to a network address ME that contains the name (IP
                          address or resolved name) of the secondary or backup MGC that controls
                          the signalling messages. The port is optional and defaults to 2944 for text
                          message formats and 2955 for binary message formats. (R, W,
                          Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
TCP/UDP pointer:          This attribute points to the TCP/UDP config data ME to be used for
                          communication with the MGC. The default value 0 is a null pointer.
                          (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Version:                  This integer attribute reports the version of the Megaco protocol in use.
                          (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Message format:           This attribute defines the message format. Valid values are:
                          0   Text long
                          1   Text short
                          2   Binary
                          The default value is 0. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Maximum retry time:       This attribute specifies the maximum retry time for MGC transactions, in
                          seconds. The default value 0 specifies vendor-specific implementation
                          (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
Maximum retry             This attribute specifies the maximum number of times a message is
attempts:                 retransmitted to the MGC. The default value 0 specifies vendor-specific
                          implementation. (R, W, Set-by-create) (optional) (2 bytes)
Service change delay:     The attribute specifies the service status delay time for changes in line
                          service status. This attribute is specified in seconds. The default value 0
                          specifies no delay. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
Termination ID base:      The attribute specifies the base string for the H.248 physical termination
                          id(s) for this ONT. This string is intended to uniquely identify an ONT.
                          Vendor-specific termination identifiers (i.e., port IDs) are optionally
                          added to this string to uniquely identify a termination on a specific ONT.
                          (R, W) (optional) (25 bytes)
Softswitch:               This attribute identifies the gateway softswitch vendor. The format is
                          four ASCII coded alphabetic characters [A..Z] as defined in
                          [ATIS-0322000]. A value of four null characters indicates no particular
                          vendor. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
