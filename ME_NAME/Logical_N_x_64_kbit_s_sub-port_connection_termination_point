9.8.2    Logical N x 64 kbit/s sub-port connection termination point
This managed entity models logical sub-ports contained within a higher level TDM physical layer
interface (e.g., DS0s within a DS1, DS1s within a DS3, etc.). An instance of this managed entity
can represent an arbitrary (i.e., consecutive or non-consecutive) group of multiple channels/time
slots (e.g., multiple DS0/DS1) as an integral bundle.
An instance of this managed entity is created by the OLT before the creation of an associated
interworking termination point (see clause 9.2.4, GEM interworking termination point).
Relationships
Zero or more instances of this ME are associated with an instance of the physical path termination
point CES UNI. It can be linked from a pseudowire TP, a logical N x 64 kbit/s CTP, or an
interworking TP.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Physical path termination     This attribute points to the corresponding physical path termination
pointer:                      point CES UNI managed entity instance. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (2 bytes)
List of time slots:           This attribute is a bit map that indicates time slots (or component
                              tributaries). Each bit indicates whether the corresponding time slot is
                              included in the connection or not. The correspondence is shown in
                              Figure 9.8.2-1.
