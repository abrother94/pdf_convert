9.12.1 UNI-G
This managed entity organizes data associated with user network interfaces (UNIs) supported by
GEM. One instance of the UNI-G managed entity exists for each UNI supported by the ONT.
The ONT automatically creates or deletes instances of this managed entity upon the creation or
deletion of a real or virtual circuit pack managed entity, one per port.
Relationships
An instance of the UNI-G managed entity exists for each instance of a physical path termination
point managed entity.
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of a physical path termination point. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Configuration option          This attribute holds the UNI configuration code field. Its bits are
status:                       assigned as shown below.

Administrative state:         This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
                              managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                              functions of this managed entity are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and
                              AVCs for this managed entity and all dependent managed entities are
                              no longer generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is
                              outside the scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
