9.1.2     ONT2-G
This managed entity contains additional attributes associated with the G-PON ONT. The ONT
automatically creates an instance of this managed entity. Its attributes are populated according to
the data within the ONT itself.
Relationships
This managed entity is paired with the ONT-G entity.
Managed entity id:     This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                       There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Equipment id:          This attribute may be used to identify the specific type of ONT. In North
                       America, this may be the equipment CLEI code. (R) (optional) (20 bytes)
OMCC version:          This attribute identifies the version of the OMCC protocol being used by the
                       ONT. This allows the OLT to manage a network with ONTs that support
                       different OMCC versions. Release levels of this Recommendation may be
                       supported with the following code points:
                       0x80     G.984.4 06/04.
                                NOTE â€“ For historic reasons, this codepoint may also appear in ONTs
                                that support later versions.
                       0x81     G.984.4 Amd.1 (06/05).
                       0x82     G.984.4 Amd.2 (03/06).
                       0x83     G.984.4 Amd.3 (12/06).
                       0x84     G.984.4 (02/08).
                       (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Vendor product code: This attribute provides a vendor-specific product code for the ONT. (R)
                       (optional) (2 bytes)
Security capability:   This attribute advertises the security capabilities of the ONT. The following
                       codepoints are defined:
                       0         Reserved.
                       1         AES encryption of the downstream payload supported.
                       2..255    Reserved.
                       (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Security mode:         This attribute specifies the current security mode of the ONT. All secure
                       GEM ports in an ONT must use the same security mode at any given time.
                       The following codepoints are defined:
                       0        Reserved.
                       1        AES algorithm used for unicast traffic.
                       2..255 Reserved.
                       Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 1, AES. If new
                       encryption modes are standardized, then AES will be the default, and the
                       new modes will be settable via writing to this attribute. This does not mean
                       that any channels are encrypted; that process is negotiated at the PLOAM
                       layer. It only signifies that AES is the security mode to be used on any
                       channels that the OLT may choose to encrypt. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Total priority queue This attribute reports the total number of priority queues that are not
number:                  associated with a circuit pack, but with the ONT in its entirety. The
                         maximum value is 0x0FFF. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this
                         attribute to the value that represents its capabilities. (R) (mandatory)
                         (2 bytes)
Total traffic            This attribute reports the total number of traffic schedulers that are not
scheduler number:        associated with a circuit pack, but with the ONT in its entirety. The ONT
                         supports null function, HOL scheduling and WRR from the priority control
                         and guarantee of minimum rate control points of view, respectively. If the
                         ONT has no traffic schedulers, this attribute is 0. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Mode:                    This attribute identifies whether the ONT can operate in ATM-only mode
                         (0), GEM-only mode (1), or both ATM and GEM mode (2). ATM mode is
                         deprecated; this attribute should always be set to 1. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Total GEM port-ID        This attribute reports the total number of GEM port-IDs supported by the
number:                  ONT. The maximum value is 0x0FFF. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets
                         this attribute to the value that represents its capabilities. (R) (optional)
                         (2 bytes)
SysUpTime:               This attribute counts the 10 ms intervals since the ONT was last initialized.
                         It rolls over to 0 when full (See [b-IETF RFC 1213]). (R) (optional)
                         (4 bytes)
