9.3.3    MAC bridge performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data associated with a MAC bridge. Instances
of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
This managed entity is associated with one instance of a MAC bridge service profile.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of the MAC bridge service profile. (R, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:            This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                              (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:        This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                              entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                              attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Bridge learning entry         This attribute counts forwarding database entries that have been or
discard count:                would have been learned but were discarded or replaced due to lack of
                              space in the database table. When used with the MAC learning depth
                              attribute of the MAC bridge service profile, the bridge learning entry
                              discard count may be particularly useful in detecting MAC spoofing
                              attempts. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)

Create, delete, get, set
