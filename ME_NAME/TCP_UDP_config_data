9.4.14 TCP/UDP config data
The TCP/UDP config data managed entity contains the configuration for TCP- and UDP-based
services that are offered from an IP host. If a non-OMCI interface is used to manage an IP service,
this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI interface supplies the necessary data.
An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted on request of the OLT.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity may be associated with an instance of an IP host
config data managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. It
                            is recommended that the managed entity id be the same as the port
                            number. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Port id:                    This attribute specifies the port number that offers the TCP/UDP service.
                            (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Protocol:                   This attribute specifies the protocol type as defined by IANA. The
                            default value is UDP (0x11) (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
TOS/diffserv field:         This attribute specifies the value of the TOS/diffserv field of the IPv4
                            header. The contents of this attribute may contain the type of service per
                            [IETF RFC 1349] or a differentiated services code point (DSCP). Valid
                            values for DSCP are as defined by IANA. The default value is 0. (R, W,
                            Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
IP host pointer:            This attribute points to the IP host config data ME associated with this
                            TCP/UDP data. Any number of ports and protocols may be associated
                            with an IP host. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
