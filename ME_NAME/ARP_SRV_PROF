9.4.10 ARP service profile
This managed entity organizes data associated with the ARP function used by an IP router. The
OLT creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity upon the creation or deletion of the
corresponding instance of IP port configuration data of native LAN type.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with one instance of IP port configuration data of
native LAN type. The actual content of a port's ARP cache is visible through the implicitly linked
ARP configuration data ME.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                            This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the slot id
                            (defined in clause 9.1.5). It is 0 if the ONT is integrated. The second
                            byte is assigned by the OLT in the range 1..255. (R, Set-by-create)
                            (mandatory) (2 bytes)
ARP timer:                  This attribute reports the maximum number of seconds that IP packets
                            are held while they are awaiting address resolution by ARP at this port.
                            (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
ARP cache clear:            The Boolean value true initializes the associated ARP cache. The value
                            false has no significance. As the value of this attribute has no physical
                            meaning, the get action always returns the value false. (R, W)
                            (mandatory) (1 byte)
