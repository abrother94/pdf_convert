9.4.1     IP router service profile
This managed entity models an IP router as a whole. It organizes data that affects all ports on the
router. An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity may be associated with a real or virtual cardholder
(slot) that supports the router function. Any number of router ports may be associated with the
router through IP port config data MEs.
The router itself is configured and monitored through implicitly linked instances of the IP router
config data, IP route table, IP static routes and IP and ICMP PM history data MEs.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                    This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                                      The first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). If the ONT is
                                      integrated, its value is 0. The second byte is the router group id.
                                      (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Forwarding ind:                       The Boolean value true globally enables forwarding of IP packets
                                      (packets may still be discarded because of other settings). The value
                                      false disables IP forwarding. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Proxy ARP ind:                        The Boolean value true enables proxy ARP. The value false disables
                                      proxy ARP. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Directed broadcast ind:               The Boolean value true enables relaying of directed broadcast packets.
                                      (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Upstream multicast            This attribute specifies whether upstream IP multicast packets are
filtering:                    forwarded (0) or filtered (1). (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Downstream multicast          This attribute specifies whether downstream IP multicast packets are
filtering:                    forwarded (0) or filtered (1). (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
