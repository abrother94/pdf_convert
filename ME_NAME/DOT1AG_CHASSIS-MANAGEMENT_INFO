9.3.26 Dot1ag chassis-management info
This managed entity represents the system-level chassis ID and/or management address for
[b-IEEE 802.1ag] CFM messages, and potentially for other 802-based functions. Although
[b-IEEE 802.1AB] allows for several management addresses (synonyms in different formats, or
with granularity to the component level), [b-IEEE 802.1ag] does not provide for more than one. Nor
provides for only one.
According to sender ID permission attributes in several dot1ag managed entities, transmitted
[b-IEEE 802.1ag] CFM messages may include either or both of the chassis ID or management
address fields. [b-IEEE 802.1ag] requires that CCMs not exceed 128 bytes, of which 74 are
separately allocated to other purposes; the sender ID TLV, if present, must accommodate this
requirement. The chassis info and management info must fit, with a minimum of 4 additional
overhead bytes, into the remaining 54 bytes. This limit is exploited in defining the maximum size of
the managed entity's attributes.
Relationships
If an ONT supports [b-IEEE 802.1ag] functionality, it automatically creates an instance of this
managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:             This attribute uniquely identifies this managed entity. There is at most
                               one instance, whose value is 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Chassis ID length:             The length of the chassis ID attribute (not including the chassis ID
                               subtype attribute), default value 0. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Chassis ID subtype:            The format of the chassis ID attribute, default value 7, as defined in
                               [b-IEEE 802.1AB]:
   1    Chassis           A particular instance of the entPhysicalAlias object (defined in
        component         [b-IETF RFC 2737]) for a chassis component.
   2    Interface alias   A particular instance of the ifAlias object (defined in [b-IETF RFC 2863]) for an
                          interface on the containing chassis.
   3    Port component    A particular instance of the entPhysicalAlias object (defined in
                          [b-IETF RFC 2737]) for a port or backplane component within the containing
                          chassis.
   4    MAC address       A particular unicast source address (encoded in network byte order and
                          [b-IEEE 802.3] canonical bit order), of a port on the containing chassis as
                          defined in [b-IEEE 802].
   5    Network address   A particular network address, encoded in network byte order, associated with
                          one or more ports on the containing chassis. The first octet contains the IANA
                          address family numbers enumeration value for the specific address type, and
                          octets 2 through N contain the network address value in network byte order.
   6    Interface name    A particular instance of the ifName object (defined in [b-IETF RFC 2863]) for
                          an interface on the containing chassis.
   7    Local             Locally assigned chassis ID.
                               (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Chassis ID part 1:        These two attributes may be regarded as an octet string of up to
Chassis ID part 2:                     50 bytes whose length is given by the chassis ID length attribute and
                               whose value is the left-justified chassis ID. (R, W) (mandatory)
                               (25 bytes * 2 attributes)
Management address             The length of the management address domain attribute, default
domain length:                 value 0. If this attribute has the value 0, all of the other management
                               address attributes are undefined. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
domain 1, Management         50 bytes whose length is given by the management address domain
address domain 2:            length attribute and whose value is the left-justified management
                             address domain. The attribute is coded as an object identifier (OID) per
                             [b-ITU-T X.690], referring to a TDomain as defined in
                             [b-IETF RFC 2579]. Typical values include snmpUDPDomain (from
                             SNMPv2-TM, [b-IETF RFC 3417]) and snmpIeee802Domain (from
                             SNMP-IEEE802-TM-MIB, [b-IETF RFC 4789]). (R, W) (mandatory)
                             (25 bytes * 2 attributes)
Management address           The length of the management address attribute, default value 0.
length:                      (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Management address 1,        These two attributes may be regarded as an octet string of up to
Management address 2:        50 bytes whose length is given by the management address length
                             attribute and whose value is the left-justified management address.
                             (R, W) (mandatory) (25 bytes * 2 attributes)
