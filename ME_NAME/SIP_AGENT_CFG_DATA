9.9.3    SIP agent config data
The SIP agent config data managed entity models a SIP signalling agent. It defines the
configuration necessary to establish communication for signalling between the SIP user agent and a
SIP server.
NOTE – If a non-OMCI interface is used to manage SIP for VoIP, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI
interface supplies the necessary data, which may be read back to the OLT via the SIP config portal ME.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity serves one or more SIP user data managed entities and points to
a TCP/UDP config data that carries signalling messages. Other pointers establish additional agent
parameters such as proxy servers.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                  entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Proxy server address              This attribute points to a large string ME that contains the name
pointer:                          (IP address or URI) of the SIP proxy server for SIP signalling
                                  messages. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Outbound proxy address     This attribute points to a large string ME that contains the name (IP
pointer:                   address or URI) of the outbound proxy server for SIP signalling
                           messages. An outbound SIP proxy may or may not be required within
                           a given network. If an outbound SIP proxy is used, the outbound
                           proxy address pointer attribute must be set to point to a valid large
                           string ME. If an outbound SIP proxy is not used, the outbound proxy
                           address pointer attribute must be set to a null pointer. (R, W,
                           Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Primary SIP DNS:           This attribute specifies the primary SIP DNS IP address. If this value
                           is 0, no primary SIP DNS is defined. The default value is 0. (R, W,
                           Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Secondary SIP DNS:         This attribute specifies the secondary SIP DNS IP address. If this
                           value is 0, no secondary SIP DNS is defined. The default value is 0.
                           (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
TCP/UDP pointer:           This pointer associates the SIP agent with the TCP/UDP config data
                           ME to be used for communication with the SIP server. The default
                           value is 0xFFFF. (R, W) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
SIP reg exp time:          This attribute specifies the SIP registration expiration time in
                           seconds. If its value is 0, the SIP agent does not add an expiration
                           time to the registration requests and does not perform re-registration.
                           The default value is 3600 seconds. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
SIP rereg head start time:  This attribute specifies the time in seconds prior to timeout that
                           causes the SIP agent to start the re-registration process. The default
                           value is 360 seconds. (R, W) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Host part URI:             This attribute points to a large string ME that contains the host or
                           domain part of the SIP address of record for users connected to this
                           ONT. The default value 0xFFFF indicates that the current address in
                           the IP host config ME is used. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                           (2 bytes)
SIP status:                This attribute shows the current status of the SIP agent. Values are as
                           follows:
                           0     Ok/initial.
                           1     Connected.
                           2     Failed – ICMP error.
                           3     Failed – Malformed response.
                           4     Failed – Inadequate info response.
                           5     Failed – Timeout.
                           (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
SIP registrar:             This attribute points to a network address ME that contains the name
                           (IP address or resolved name) of the registrar server for SIP
                           signalling messages. Examples: "10.10.10.10" and "proxy.voip.net".
                           The default value is 0xFFFF. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                           (2 bytes)
Softswitch:                This attribute identifies the SIP gateway softswitch vendor. The
                           format is four ASCII coded alphabetic characters [A..Z] as defined in
                           [ATIS-0322000]. A value of four null characters indicates no
                           particular vendor. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (4 bytes)

     208..223       Vendor-specific alarms          Not to be standardized
 NOTE – These alarms are deprecated, and retained for backward compatibility. It is recommended that the
 SIP agent config data not declare these alarms, but that they be declared by the SIP user data ME instead.
 In any event, only one ME should declare the alarm, not both.
