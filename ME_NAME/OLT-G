9.12.2 OLT-G
NOTE â€“ Except for its name, this managed entity is identical to the OLTB-PON ME documented in
[ITU-T G.983.2].
This optional managed entity identifies the OLT to which an ONT is connected. This ME provides
a way for the ONT to configure itself for operability with a particular OLT.
An ONT that supports this managed entity automatically creates an instance of it. Immediately
following the startup phase, the OLT should set the ONT to the desired configuration. Interpretation
of the attributes is a matter for negotiation between the two vendors involved.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity is associated with the ONT managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:       This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                         There is only one instance, number 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
OLT vendor id:           This attribute identifies the OLT vendor. It is the same as the 4 most
                         significant bytes of an ONT serial number specified in [ITU-T G.984.3].
                         Upon instantiation, this attribute comprises all spaces. (R, W) (mandatory)
                         (4 bytes)
Equipment id:            This attribute may be used to identify the specific type of OLT. The
                         default value of all spaces indicates that equipment ID information is not
                         available or applicable to the OLT being represented. (R, W) (mandatory)
                         (20 bytes)
Version:                 This attribute identifies the version of the OLT as defined by the vendor.
                         The default left-justified ASCII string "0" (padded with trailing nulls)
                         indicates that version information is not available or applicable to the OLT
                         being represented. (R, W) (mandatory) (14 bytes)
