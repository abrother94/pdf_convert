9.6.4     802.11 general purpose object
Relationships
Up to four instances of this managed entity may exist for each instance of an [IEEE 802.11]
interface, one of each type. An instance contains one of the following [IEEE 802.11] data types:
WEP key mappings, group addresses, supported regulatory domains, and antennas list. Each use has
its own attributes, and a type attribute indicates which subset is active for each instance. Regardless
of which attributes are active, each attribute is numbered, in the OMCC attribute mask, according to
the ordering of the full attribute set indicated below.
For object types 0 and 1, the OLT may create and delete instances of this object. For object types 2
and 3, the ONT creates as many instances as required to model the UNI's capabilities.
Attributes
Managed entity id:               This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                 entity. When created automatically by the ONT, the ME ID is known
                                 to the OLT through out of band means, for example documentation.
                                 (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Object type:                     This attribute indicates how this entity is used:
                                 0 WEP key mapping.
                                 1 Group addresses.
                                 2 Reg domain supported.
                                 3 Antennas list.
                                 For any given type, only the relevant attributes are valid. The other
                                 attributes are unspecified. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Physical path termination        This attribute points to the specific physical path termination
point 802.11 pointer:            point 802.11 UNI to which this instance corresponds.
                                 (R, Set-by create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Attributes valid only if object type = 0, WEP key mapping:
dot11 WEP key mapping            The MAC address of the STA for which the values from this key
address:                         mapping entry are to be used. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                                 (6 bytes)
WEP on:                          with the dot11 WEP key mapping address STA. (R, W,
                                 Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 WEP key mapping            A WEP secret key value. (W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
value:
Attributes valid only if object type = 1, group addresses:
dot11 address:                   A multicast MAC address from which this STA receives frames.
                                 (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (6 bytes)
Attributes valid only if object type = 2, reg domain supported:
dot11 reg domains support Operational requirements differ, depending on the regulatory
value:                           domain. This attribute list describes the regulatory domains that the
                                 PLCP and PMD support in this implementation. Currently defined
                                 values and their corresponding regulatory domains are:
                                 0x10    FCC (USA).
                                 0x20    DOC (Canada).
                                 0x30    ETSI (most of Europe).
                                 0x31    Spain.
                                 0x32    France.
                                 0x40    MKK (Japan).
                                 (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Attributes valid only if object type = 3, antennas list:
dot11 supported tx antenna: When true, this Boolean attribute indicates that the antenna
                                 represented by the associated PPTP can be used as a transmit
                                 antenna. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 supported rx antenna: When true, this Boolean attribute indicates that the antenna
                                 represented by the associated PPTP can be used as a receive antenna.
                                 (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 diversity selection rx: When true, this Boolean attribute indicates that the antenna
                                 represented by the associated PPTP can be used for receive diversity.
                                 This attribute can only be true if the antenna can be used as a receive
                                 antenna, as indicated by dot11 supported rx antenna. (R, W)
                                 (mandatory) (1 byte)
