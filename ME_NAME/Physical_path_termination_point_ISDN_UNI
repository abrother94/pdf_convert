9.9.21 Physical path termination point ISDN UNI
This managed entity represents the point at a basic rate ISDN UNI where physical paths terminate
and physical path level functions (e.g., analogue telephony, facsimile function) are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•        When the ONT has ISDN ports built into its factory configuration.
•        When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of ISDN type.
•        When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of ISDN
         type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of ISDN
         ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
         port mapping package that specifies ISDN ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an ISDN circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an ISDN circuit pack.
Relationships
One or more instances of this managed entity are associated with the ONT-G or a circuit pack
managed entity classified as ISDN type.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the UNI. The
                           first byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte is the
                           port ID, with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Administrative state:      This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
                           managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                           functions of this UNI are blocked, and alarms, TCAs and AVCs for this
                           managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer
                           generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the
                           scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Interworking pointer:      This attribute points to the instance of the GEM interworking termination
                           point managed entity to which this instance is connected. The value 0 is
                           a null pointer. (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
D channel ID:              This attribute contains the channel identifier of the connection
                           transporting the D channel associated with this ISDN BRI port. (R, W)
                           (mandatory) (1 byte)
B1 channel ID:             This attribute contains the channel identifier of the connection
                           transporting the B1 channel associated with this ISDN BRI port. (R, W)
                           (mandatory) (1 byte)
B2 channel ID:             This attribute contains the channel identifier of the connection
                           transporting the B2 channel associated with this ISDN BRI port. (R, W)
                           (mandatory) (1 byte)
ARC:                       See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:              See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ISDN loopback              This attribute controls the loopback configuration of this physical
configuration:             interface.
                           0 No loopback.
                           1 Simultaneous loopback of all channels.
                           1 Loopback of D channel only [sic].
                           2 Loopback of B1 channel only.
                           3 Loopback of B2 channel only.
                           Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 0. (R, W)
                           (mandatory) (1 byte)
