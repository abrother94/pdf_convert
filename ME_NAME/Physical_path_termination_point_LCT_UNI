9.13.3 Physical path termination point LCT UNI
This managed entity represents the local craft terminal UNI, where physical paths terminate and
physical path level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•         When the ONT has LCT ports built into its factory configuration.
•         When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of LCT type.
•         When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of LCT
          type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of LCT
          ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to instantiate a
          port mapping package that specifies LCT ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect an LCT circuit pack, nor is it equipped with an LCT circuit pack.
LCT instances are not reported during a MIB upload.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a real or virtual circuit pack
managed entity classified as LCT type.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the UNI. The first
                          byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte is the port ID,
                          with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Administrative            This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this
state:                    managed entity. When the administrative state is set to lock, all user
                          functions of this UNI are blocked. Selection of a default value for this
                          attribute is outside the scope of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
