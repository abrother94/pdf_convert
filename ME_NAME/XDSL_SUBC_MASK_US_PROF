9.7.9    xDSL subcarrier masking upstream profile
This managed entity contains the subcarrier masking upstream profile for an xDSL line. An
instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           The value 0 is reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Upstream subcarrier        This attribute is a bit map representing upstream mask values for
mask:                      subcarriers 1 to 64. The MSB of byte 1 corresponds to subcarrier 1, and
                           the LSB of byte 8 corresponds to subcarrier 64. Each bit position defines
                           whether the corresponding downstream subcarrier is masked (1) or not
                           masked (default value 0).
                           Subcarrier number 1 is the lowest, and subcarrier number NSCus is the
                           highest subcarrier that can be transmitted in the upstream direction. For
                           [ITU-T G.992.3], [ITU-T G.992.4] and [ITU-T G.992.5], it is defined in
                           the corresponding Recommendation. For Annex A of [ITU-T G.992.1]
                           and [b-ITU-T G.992.2], NSCus = 32 and for Annex B of
                           [ITU-T G.992.1], NSCus = 64. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
