9.3.15 Dot1X configuration profile
An instance of this managed entity represents a set of attributes that control an ONT's
[b-IEEE 802.1X] operation with regard to IEEE 802 services. An instance of this managed entity is
created by the ONT if it is capable of supporting [b-IEEE 802.1X].
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity governs the ONT's 802.1X behaviour.
Attributes
Managed entity id:           This attribute provides a unique number for each instance of this
                             managed entity. There is at most one instance, number 0. (R)
                             (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Circuit ID prefix:           This attribute is a pointer to a large string managed entity whose
                             content appears as the prefix of the NAS port ID in radius
                             access-request messages. The remainder of the NAS port ID field is
                             local information (for example slot-port, appended by the ONT itself).
                             The default value of this attribute is the null pointer 0. (R, W)
                             (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Fallback policy:             When set to 1 (deny), this attribute causes 802.1X conversations to fail
                             when no external authentication server is accessible, such that no
                             Ethernet service is provided. The default value 0 causes 802.1X
                             conversations to succeed when no external authentication server is
                             accessible. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Auth server 1:               This attribute is a pointer to a large string managed entity that contains
                             the URI of the first choice radius authentication server. The value 0
                             indicates that no radius authentication server is specified. (R, W)
                             (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Shared secret auth1:         This attribute is the shared secret for the first radius authentication
                             server. It is a null-terminated character string. (R, W) (mandatory)
                             (25 bytes)
                             The following two pairs of attributes are defined in the same way:
Auth server 2:               (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
Shared secret auth2:         (R, W) (optional) (25 bytes)
Auth server 3:               (R, W) (optional) (2 bytes)
Shared secret auth3:         (R, W) (optional) (25 bytes)
OLT proxy address:           This attribute indicates the IP address of a possible proxy at the OLT
                             for 802.1X radius messages. The default value 0.0.0.0 indicates that no
                             proxy is required. (R, W) (optional) (4 bytes)
