9.13.2 Physical path termination point video ANI
This managed entity represents an RF video ANI in the ONT, where physical paths terminate and
physical path level functions are performed.
The ONT automatically creates an instance of this managed entity per port:
•        When the ONT has video ANI ports built into its factory configuration.
•        When a cardholder is provisioned to expect a circuit pack of video ANI type.
•        When a cardholder provisioned for plug-and-play is equipped with a circuit pack of video
         ANI type. Note that the installation of a plug-and-play card may indicate the presence of
         video ANI ports via equipment ID as well as its type, and indeed may cause the ONT to
         instantiate a port mapping package that specifies video ANI ports.
The ONT automatically deletes instances of this managed entity when a cardholder is neither
provisioned to expect a video ANI circuit pack, nor is it equipped with a video ANI circuit pack.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a real or preprovisioned video
ANI port.
Attributes
Managed entity id:     This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                       This two-byte number indicates the physical position of the ANI. The first
                       byte is the slot id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte is the port ID,
                       with range 1..255. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Administrative         This attribute locks (1) and unlocks (0) the functions performed by this

                       for this managed entity and all dependent managed entities are no longer
                       generated. Selection of a default value for this attribute is outside the scope
                       of this Recommendation. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)

                      (R) (optional) (1 byte)
Pilot signal level:   This attribute indicates the current measurement of the pilot signal level or
                      broadband RF level. The unit of this attribute is dBµV at the RF video
                      service port.
                      •        If signal capability = 0 or 1, then this attribute is undefined.
                      •        If signal capability = 2, 3, 4 or 5, this attribute reports the pilot

                      results in a CNR of 47 dBc for a channel of 4.5 MHz bandwidth at a
                      receive optical power of –5 dBm. The unit of this attribute is dBµW
                      optical. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Signal level max:     This attribute indicates the maximum optical RF power per channel that
                      results in a CTB of –57 dBc for an 80-channel ensemble of carriers at a
                      per-channel optical modulation index of 3.5%. The unit of this attribute is

AGC mode:             This attribute allows the discovery and configuration of the ONT's AGC
                      capabilities. The attribute contains a codepoint for several AGC types. The
                      ONT displays the currently used AGC mode. The OLT can discover new
                      modes via the set command; the ONT denies attempts to set an
                      unsupported mode. The code points are:
                      0              No AGC.

                      (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
AGC setting:          This attribute indicates the measurement offset that the ONT should use in
                      AGC. The attribute has a step size of 0.1 dB, represented as a signed
                      integer.
                      The theoretical nominal RF signal is 80 channels of NTSC video, each
                      having a per-channel optical modulation index of 3.5%. An ONT
                      presented with such a signal should produce its specified output when this
                      attribute is set to zero.
                      If total optical power is used for AGC, this attribute provides the OMI
                      offset for any NTSC carriers present from the theoretical 3.5% value. For
                      example, if the actual signal uses an OMI of 7.0% per channel (3 dB
                      higher), then the ONT should be given an AGC setting of 30
                      (coded 0x1E).
                      If broadband RF power is used for AGC, this attribute provides the total
                      power offset for any NTSC carriers present from the theoretical 80 channel
                      value. For example, if an actual signal contains 40 NTSC channels (3 dB
                      lower), then the ONT should be given an AGC setting of –30 (coded
                      0xE2).

Video lower optical   This attribute specifies the optical level used to declare the video OOR low
threshold:            alarm. Valid values are –12 to +6 dBm in 0.1 dB increments, represented
                      as a 2s complement integer (coding –120 to +60, where 0x00 = 0 dBm,
                      0x88 = –12.0 dBm, etc.). Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this
                      attribute to 0xA1 (–9.5 dBm). (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
                      NOTE – Because the power measurement returned in the optical signal level
                      attribute has a resolution of 1 dB, it is possible that the measured value could
                      appear to be in-range, even though an out-of-range alarm has been declared
                      against a threshold with 0.1 dB resolution.
Video upper optical   This attribute specifies the optical level used to declare the video OOR
threshold:            high alarm. Valid values are –12 to +6 dBm in 0.1 dB increments,
                      represented as a 2s complement integer (coding –120 to +60,
                      0x00 = 0dBm, 0x88 = –12.0 dBm, etc.). Upon ME instantiation, the ONT
                      sets this attribute to 0x19 (+2.5 dBm). (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
