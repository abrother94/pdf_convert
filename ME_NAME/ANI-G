9.2.1   ANI-G
This managed entity organizes data associated with each access network interface supported by the
ONT. The ONT automatically creates one instance of this managed entity for each PON physical
port.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a physical PON interface.
Attributes
Managed entity id:     This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. Its
                       value indicates the physical position of the PON IF. The first byte is the slot
                       id (defined in clause 9.1.5). The second byte is the port ID. (R) (mandatory)
                       (2 bytes)
SR indication:         This Boolean attribute indicates the ONT's capability to report queue status
                       for DBA. The value true means that status reporting is available for all
                       T-CONTs that are associated with the ANI. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Total T-CONT           This attribute indicates the total number of T-CONTs that can be supported
number:                on this ANI. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
GEM block length:      This attribute specifies the reporting block size for GEM mode, in units of
                       bytes. The value set by the OLT is used by all T-CONTs on this ANI. Upon
                       ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 48. (R, W) (mandatory)
                       (2 bytes)
reporting:            capabilities. [ITU-T G.984.3] defines three possible piggyback reporting
                      modes. For reporting mode 0, the single field is the entire report. For
                      reporting mode 1, the DBA report is two fields long. For reporting mode 2,
                      the DBA report is four fields long. Mode 0 is mandatory for ONTs that
                      utilize the piggyback DBA reporting method; modes 1 and 2 are optional.
                      The following coding indicates the ONT's piggyback DBA reporting mode
                      capabilities:
                      0        Mode 0 only.
                      1        Modes 0 and 1.
                      2        Modes 0 and 2.
                      3        Modes 0, 1 and 2.
                      4        Piggyback DBA reporting not supported.
                      (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Whole ONT DBA         This attribute indicates that the ONT supports whole ONT DBA reporting
reporting:            (1) as specified in [ITU-T G.984.3], or that it does not (0). (R) (mandatory)
                      (1 byte)
SF threshold:         This attribute specifies the downstream BER threshold to detect the SFi/SF
                      alarm. When this value is y, the BER threshold is 10–y. Valid values are 3..8.
                      Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 5. (R, W) (mandatory)
                      (1 byte)
SD threshold:         This attribute specifies the downstream BER threshold to detect the SDi/SD
                      alarm. When this value is x, the BER threshold for SDi/SD is 10–x. Valid
                      values are 4..10. The SD threshold must be lower than the SF threshold; that
                      is, x > y. Upon ME instantiation, the ONT sets this attribute to 9. (R, W)
                      (mandatory) (1 byte)
ARC:                  See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ARC interval:         See clause I.1.8. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Optical signal level: This attribute reports the current measurement of total optical signal level at
                      1490 nm. Its value is a 2s complement integer referred to 1 mW (i.e., dBm),
                      with 0.002 dB granularity. (R) (optional) (2 bytes)
Lower optical         This attribute specifies the optical level the ONT uses to declare the
threshold:            1490 nm low received optical power alarm. Valid values are –127 dBm
                      (coded as 254) to 0 dBm (coded as 0) in 0.5 dB increments. The default
                      value 0xFF selects the ONT's internal policy. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Upper optical         This attribute specifies the optical level the ONT uses to declare the
threshold:            1490 nm high received optical power alarm. Valid values are –127 dBm
                      (coded as 254) to 0 dBm (coded as 0) in 0.5 dB increments. The default
                      value 0xFF selects the ONT's internal policy. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
ONT response time: This attribute indicates actual ONT response time recorded by ONT. The
                        range of this attribute should be in the range described in
                        [ITU-T G.984.3], which is 34..36 microseconds. The unit is nanoseconds;
                        however, the accuracy is likely to be more coarse. Furthermore, the value
                        may change from one ranging cycle to the next. Valid values are:
                        0                     null, function not supported.
                        34000 to 36000        response time in nanoseconds.
                        All other values reserved.
                        (R) (optional) (2 bytes)
Transmit optical        This attribute reports the current measurement of optical transmit power
level:                  level. Its value is a 2s complement integer referred to 1 mW (i.e., dBm),
                        with 0.002 dB granularity. (R) (optional) (2 bytes)
Lower transmit          This attribute specifies the transmit power level the ONT uses to declare the
power threshold:        low transmit optical power alarm. Its value is a 2s complement integer
                        referred to 1 mW (i.e., dBm), with 0.5 dB granularity. The default value
                        –63.5 (0x81) selects the ONT's internal policy. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
Upper transmit          This attribute specifies the transmit power level the ONT uses to declare the
power threshold:        high transmit optical power alarm. Its value is a 2s complement integer
                        referred to 1 mW (i.e., dBm), with 0.5 dB granularity. The default value
                        –63.5 (0x81) selects the ONT's internal policy. (R, W) (optional) (1 byte)
