9.5.3    Ethernet performance monitoring history data 2
This managed entity collects additional performance monitoring data for an Ethernet interface.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this Ethernet performance monitoring history data 2 managed entity is associated
with an instance of the physical path termination point Ethernet UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of the physical path termination point Ethernet UNI. (R,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:            This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                              (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:        This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                              entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                              attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
PPPoE filtered frame          This attribute counts the number of frames discarded due to PPPoE
counter:                      filtering. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Actions
Create, delete, get, set
Get current data (optional)
Notifications
 Threshold crossing alert

       0         PPPoE filtered frame counter                                      1
 NOTE â€“ This number associates the TCA with the specified threshold value attribute of the threshold data 1
 managed entity.
