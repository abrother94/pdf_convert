9.3.11 VLAN tagging filter data
This managed entity organizes data associated with VLAN tagging. Instances of this managed
entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a MAC bridge port
configuration data managed entity. By definition, tag filtering occurs closer to the MAC bridge than
the tagging operation. Schematically, the ordering of the functions is:
ANI – Tag_operation – Tag_filtering – Bridging – Tag_filtering – Tag_operation – UNI
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of the MAC bridge port configuration data ME.
                              (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
VLAN filter list:             This attribute lists provisioned TCI values for the bridge port. A TCI
                              value (consisting of user priority, CFI and VID) is represented by
                              2 bytes. 12 VLAN entries are supported. The first N are valid, where N
                              is given by the number of entries attribute. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (24 bytes)
Forward operation:            When a frame is received, it is processed according to the operation
                              specified by the forward operation table. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                              (mandatory) (1 byte)

Supplementary explanation
This clause explains the actions specified in the forward operation attribute.
The format of an Ethernet frame for VLAN services is described in [IEEE 802.1Q]:
a)  Basic MAC bridge       As shown in Figure 9.3.11-2, if the DA (destination MAC address) in
    operation:             the received frame is listed in the MAC bridge port bridge table data
                           for one or more ports, this frame is forwarded on those ports.
                           Otherwise, it is flooded to all ports except the receiving port. From the
                           viewpoint of the transmitting port, a frame is forwarded either if its DA
                           is in the port's MAC bridge port bridge table data or if its DA does not
                           appear in the MAC bridge port bridge table data of any port on the
                           bridge. This is the basic behaviour of a bridge that is not aware of
                           VLANs.
                        Figure 9.3.11-2 – Basic MAC bridge operation
Other possible actions are as follows.
b)   Unconditional forwarding of A tagged frame is forwarded without investigation of TCI.
     tagged frame:
c)   Unconditional discarding of        A tagged frame is discarded without investigation of TCI.
     tagged frame:
d)   Unconditional forwarding of An untagged frame is forwarded without investigation of TCI.
     untagged frame:
e)   Unconditional discarding of        An untagged frame is discarded without investigation of TCI.
     untagged frame:
f)   Positive filtering by TCI:         If some or all (Note) of the fields in the TCI of the received
                                        frame are included in the VLAN filter list, it is forwarded
                                        according to action a) as shown in Figure 9.3.11-3. Otherwise,
                                        its TCI is ignored and it is controlled by action a).
                         Figure 9.3.11-3 – Positive filtering by TCI operation
NOTE – The phrase some or all refers to the parts or the entirety of the TCI field called out by the specific
value provisioned into the forward operation attribute.
g)   Negative filtering by TCI:        If some or all of the fields in the TCI of the received frame are
                                       included in the VLAN filter list, it is not forwarded by this port.
                                       Otherwise, it is forwarded according to action a) as shown in
                                       Figure 9.3.11-4.
                       Figure 9.3.11-4 – Negative filtering by TCI operation
h)   Positive filtering by TCI       If some or all of the fields in the TCI of the received frame are
     and dropping for no match: included in the VLAN filter list, it is forwarded according to
                                     action a) as shown in Figure 9.3.11-5. If its TCI is not accepted
                                     by any port on the bridge, the frame is discarded.
