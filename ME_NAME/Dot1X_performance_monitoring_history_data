9.3.16 Dot1X performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance statistics on an ONT's IEEE 802.1X operation. Instances
of this managed entity are created and deleted by the ONT on request of the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with each UNI that can perform IEEE 802
authentication.
Managed entity id:           This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                             entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                             linked to an instance of a physical path termination point.
                             (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:           This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute
                             interval. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:       This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2
                             managed entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W,
                             Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
EAPOL frames received:       This attribute counts received valid EAPOL frames of any type.
                             (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAPOL frames transmitted:    This attribute counts transmitted EAPOL frames of any type. (R)
                             (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAPOL start frames received: This attribute counts received EAPOL start frames. (R)
                             (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAPOL logoff frames          This attribute counts received EAPOL logoff frames. (R)
received:                    (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Invalid EAPOL frames         This attribute counts received EAPOL frames in which the frame
received:                    type was not recognized. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAP resp/id frames received: This attribute counts received EAP response frames containing an
                             identifier type field. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAP response frames          This attribute counts received EAP response frames, other than
received:                    resp/id frames. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAP initial request frames   This attribute counts transmitted request frames containing an
transmitted:                 identifier type field. In [b-IEEE 802.1X], this is also called ReqId.
                             (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAP request frames           This attribute counts transmitted request frames, other than
transmitted:                 request/id frames. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAP length error frames      This attribute counts received EAPOL frames whose packet body
received:                    length field was invalid. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAP success frames generated This attribute counts EAPOL success frames generated according
autonomously:                to local fallback policy because no radius server was available.
                             (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
EAP failure frames generated This attribute counts EAPOL failure frames generated according
autonomously:                to local fallback policy because no radius server was available.
                             (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
