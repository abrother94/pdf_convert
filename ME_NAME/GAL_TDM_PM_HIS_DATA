9.2.10 GAL TDM performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data from segmentation and reassembly
(SAR) and convergence sublayer (CS) levels of a GEM interworking termination point that
supports GAL TDM.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted on request of the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
One instance of this managed entity may exist for each instance of the GEM interworking
termination point managed entity that represents GAL TDM functions.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                              Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                              instance of the GEM interworking termination point ME.
                              (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:            This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval.
                              (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:        This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                              entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                              attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional. (R, W,
                              Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
GEM frame loss:               This attribute counts the number of lost GEM frames. It records the
                              number of GEM frames detected as lost in the network prior to the
                              destination interworking function GTC adaptation layer processing. (R)
                              (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Buffer underflows:            This attribute counts the number of times the reassembly buffer
                              underflows. In the case of continuous underflow caused by a loss of
                              GEM frame flow, a single buffer underflow should be counted. If the
                              interworking function is implemented with multiple buffers, such as a
                              cell level buffer and a bit level buffer, then either buffer underflow
                              causes this count to be incremented. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Buffer overflows:             This attribute counts the number of       times the reassembly buffer
                              overflows. If the interworking function   is implemented with multiple
                              buffers, such as a cell level buffer and  a bit level buffer, then either
                              buffer overflow causes this count to be   incremented. (R) (mandatory)
                              (4 bytes)
