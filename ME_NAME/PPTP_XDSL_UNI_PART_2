9.7.2     Physical path termination point xDSL UNI part 2
This managed entity represents the point in the ONT where physical paths terminate on an xDSL
CO modem (xTU-C). Standards and chip sets support several forms of DSL, including VDSL2, and
the xDSL managed entity family is used for all of them, with specific extensions for technology
variations (a legacy family of managed entities is documented in [ITU-T G.983.2] for
[ITU-T G.993.1] VDSL1).
The ONT creates or deletes an instance of this managed entity at the same time it creates or deletes
the corresponding PPTP xDSL UNI part 1.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with each instance of a physical path termination
point xDSL UNI part 1.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                           This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this
                                             managed entity. Through an identical ID, this managed
                                             entity is implicitly linked to an instance of the physical
                                             path termination point xDSL UNI part 1. (R) (mandatory)

                                             Each of the following eight attributes is a pointer to an
                                             xDSL channel configuration profile managed entity. In
                                             each case, the default value 0, set when the ME is
                                             auto-created, is a null pointer.
