9.9.5     VoIP media profile
The VoIP media profile managed entity contains settings that apply to VoIP voice encoding. This
entity is conditionally required for ONTs that offer VoIP services. If a non-OMCI interface is used
to manage VoIP signalling, this ME is unnecessary. The non-OMCI interface supplies the necessary
data, which may be read back to the OLT via the SIP config portal ME or the MGC config
portal ME.
An instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT. A VoIP media profile is
needed for each unique set of profile attributes.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with one or more VoIP voice CTP managed
entities.
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)

                                          DTMF tones are carried in the PCM stream. (R, W,
