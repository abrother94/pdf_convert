9.9.11 VoIP line status
The VoIP line status managed entity contains line status information for POTS ports using VoIP
service. An ONT that supports VoIP automatically creates or deletes an instance of this managed
entity upon creation or deletion of a PPTP POTS UNI.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with a PPTP POTS UNI.
Attributes
Managed entity id:         This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                           Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                           instance of the physical path termination point POTS UNI. (R)
                           (mandatory) (2 bytes)
voip codec used:           Reports the current codec used for a VoIP POTS port. Valid values are
                           taken from [IETF RFC 3551], the same as specified in the codec
                           selection attribute in the VoIP media profile:
