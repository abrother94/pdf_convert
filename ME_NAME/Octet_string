9.12.11 Octet string
The octet string is modelled on the large string managed entity. The large string is constrained to
printable characters because it uses null as a trailing delimiter. The octet string has a length attribute
and is therefore suitable for arbitrary sequences of bytes.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT. To use this managed entity,
the OLT instantiates the octet string ME and then points to the created ME from other ME
instances. Systems that maintain the octet string should ensure that the octet string ME is not
deleted while it is still linked.
Relationships
An instance of this ME may be cited by any ME that requires an octet string that can exceed 25
bytes in length.
Attributes
Managed entity id:          This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity. The
                            values 0 and 0xFFFF are reserved. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                            (2 bytes)
                         octets. This attribute defaults to 0 to indicate no octet string is defined. The
                         maximum value of this attribute is 375 (15 parts, 25 bytes each). (R, W)
                         (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                         Fifteen additional attributes are defined below; they are identical. The octet string is simply divided
                         into as many parts as necessary, starting at part 1 and left justified.
                         Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, Part 7, Part 8, Part 9, Part 10, Part 11, Part 12,
                         Part 13, Part 14, Part 15: (R, W) (part 1 mandatory, others optional) (25 bytes * 15 attributes)
