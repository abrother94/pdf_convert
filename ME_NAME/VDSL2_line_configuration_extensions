9.7.6    VDSL2 line configuration extensions
This managed entity extends the xDSL line configuration MEs with attributes that are unique to
[ITU-T G.993.2] VDSL2. The attributes of this ME are further defined in [ITU-T G.997.1]. An
instance of this managed entity is created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of the physical
path termination point xDSL UNI part 1.
The overall xDSL line configuration profile is modelled in several parts, all of which are associated
together through a common managed entity id (the client physical path termination point xDSL UNI
part 1 has a single pointer, which refers to the entire set of line configuration parts).
Managed entity id:   This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                     All xDSL and VDSL2 line configuration profiles that pertain to a given
                     physical path termination point xDSL must share a common managed
                     entity id. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
VDSL2 profiles       This attribute (PROFILES) contains the G.993.2 profiles to be allowed
enabling:            by the xTU-C. It is coded in a bit map representation (0 if not allowed, 1
                     if allowed) with the following definition:
                     Bit         Meaning

                           of [ITU-T G.993.2]).
                     •     Class HPE-M1 Annex B: HPE17-M1-NUS0, HPE30-M1-NUS0.
                     Each class is designed such that the PSD levels of each limit PSD mask
                     of a specific class are equal in their respective passbands above 552 kHz.
                     The CLASSMASK attribute is defined per annex enabled in the xTSE
                     table (see Table 9.7.12-1). It selects a single PSD mask class per annex to
                     be activated at the VTU-O. The coding is as follows:

                       annex. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (1 byte)
VDSL2 limit PSD        The LIMITMASK attribute contains the G.993.2 limit PSD masks of the
masks:                 selected PSD mask class, enabled by the near-end xTU for each class of
                       profiles. One LIMITMASK parameter is defined per annex enabled in
                       the xTSE (see Table 9.7.12-1).
                       The profiles are grouped in the following profile classes:
                          – Class 8: Profiles 8a, 8b, 8c, 8d.
                          – Class 12: Profiles 12a, 12b.
                          – Class 17: Profile 17a.
                          – Class 30: Profile 30a.
                       For each profile class, several limit PSD masks of the selected PSD mask
                       class (CLASSMASK) may be enabled. The enabling attribute is coded in
                       a bit map representation (0 if the associated mask is not allowed, 1 if it is
                       allowed). The bit mask is defined in Table 9.7.6-1. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                       (mandatory) (8 bytes)
VDSL2 US0 disabling:   The US0DISABLE attribute specifies whether channel US0 is disabled
                       for each limit PSD mask enabled in the LIMITMASK attribute.
                       For each limit PSD mask enabled in the LIMITMASK attribute, one bit
                       indicates if US0 is disabled. The disabling attribute is a bit map where
                       the value 1 specifies that US0 is disabled for the associated limit mask.
                       The bit map has the same structure as the LIMITMASK attribute. (R, W,
                       Set-by-create) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
VDSL2 US0 PSD masks: The US0MASK attribute contains the US0 PSD masks to be allowed by
                       the xTU-C. This attribute is only defined for Annex A of
                       [ITU-T G.993.2]. It is represented as a bit map (0 if not allowed, 1 if
                       allowed) with the definitions of Table 9.7.6-2. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                       (mandatory) (4 bytes)
VDSL2-CARMASK          This attribute specifies restrictions, additional to the band plan, that
table:                 determine the set of subcarriers allowed for transmission in both
                       upstream and downstream directions.
               The VDSL2-CARMASK attribute describes the not-masked subcarriers
               in terms of one or more frequency bands. Each band is represented by
               start and stop subcarrier indices with a subcarrier spacing of 4.3125 kHz.
               The valid range of subcarrier indices is from 0 to at least the index of the
               highest allowed subcarrier in both transmission directions among all
               profiles enabled by the VDSL2 profiles enabling (PROFILES) attribute.
               Up to 32 bands may be specified. Other subcarriers are masked.
               For profiles using 8.625 kHz tone spacing, the odd subcarrier indices
               i4.3125 in VDSL2-CARMASK can be transformed into actual subcarrier
               indices i8.625 using the following rule:
               –         For the start frequency of each band: i8.625 = (i4.3125 + 1)/2.
               –         For the stop frequency of each band: i8.625 = (i4.3125 – 1)/2.
               The VDSL2-CARMASK attribute is a table where each entry comprises:
               –         An entry number field (1 byte, first entry numbered 1).
               –         Band start subcarrier index (2 bytes).
               –         Band stop subcarrier index (2 bytes).
               By default, the table is empty. Entries are added or modified using the set
               action, which permits from one to as many as six breakpoints to be
               addressed in a single set message (Note 2). Setting a table entry with
               non-zero subcarrier references implies insertion into the table. Setting an
               entry's subcarrier references to zero implies deletion from the table, if
               present.
               NOTE 2 – OMCI does not provide robust exception handling when more than
               one entry is included in a set command, and multiple values per set operation
               are not recommended.
               The maximum number of breakpoints is 32, so the maximum size of the
               table is 160 bytes. (R, W) (mandatory) (5N bytes, where N is the number
               of bands)
CARMASK valid: This attribute controls and reports the status of the VDSL2-CARMASK
               table. If CARMASK valid = 1, then the VDSL2-CARMASK has been
               effectuated on the xDSL equipment. If CARMASK valid = 0 (default),
               then the VDSL2-CARMASK table is under construction and has not
               been effectuated on the xDSL equipment.
               This attribute behaves as follows:
               •         If the OLT changes any of the VDSL2-CARMASK table entries
                         or sets CARMASK valid = 0, then CARMASK valid = 0.
               •         If CARMASK valid = 0 and the OLT sets CARMASK valid = 1,
                         then the ONT updates the xDSL equipment with the content of
                         the table.
               (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
UPBOSHAPED:              Upstream power back-off (UPBO) is specified in [ITU-T G.993.2] to
                         provide spectral compatibility between loops of different lengths
                         deployed in the same cable binder. The upstream transmit PSD mask,
                         UPBOMASKus is defined in clause 7.2.1.3.2 of [ITU-T G.993.2] using
                         the formula:
                         UPBOMASK (kl0 , f ) = UPBOPSD( f ) + LOSS (kl0 , f ) + 3.5 [dBm/Hz]
                          LOSS (kl0 , f ) = kl0 f    [dB]
                         where UPBOPSD(f) = –a-b√f.
                         The UPBO configuration attributes a and b are set by the OLT via this
                         attribute. The value of kl0 may be determined during initialization by the
                         VTUs or also set by the OLT. Further detail appears in [ITU-T G.997.1].
                         This attribute includes two parameters for each band. The parameters are
                         a and b, in that order. Parameter a lies in the range 4000 (40.00 dBm/Hz)
                         to 8095 (80.95 dBm/Hz). Parameter b lies in the range 0 (0.00 dBm/Hz)
                         to 4095 (40.95 dBm/Hz). The special values a = b = 0 disable UPBO in
                         the respective upstream band.
                         The upstream electrical length parameter UPBOKL defines the electrical
                         length expressed in dB at 1 MHz, kl0, which may also be configured by
                         the OLT. Its value ranges from 0 (0.0 dB) to 1280 (128.0 dB).
                         If the force electrical length parameter UPBOKLF is 1, the VTU-R is
                         forced to use the electrical length from this attribute (UPBOKL) to
                         compute UPBO. Otherwise, the VTUs determine the electrical length
                         themselves.
                           Upstream band 1                         a          2 bytes

                         (R, W) (mandatory) (23 bytes)
Cyclic extension:        The CEFLAG attribute enables (1) the optional cyclic extension values.
                         If set to 0, the cyclic extension is forced to the mandatory length 5N/32.
                         (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Downstream SNR mode:The SNRMODEds attribute controls transmitter referred virtual noise in
                         the downstream direction. If set to 1, virtual noise is disabled. If set to 2,
                         virtual noise is enabled. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Upstream SNR mode:     The SNRMODEus attribute controls transmitter referred virtual noise in
                       the upstream direction. If set to 1, virtual noise is disabled. If set to 2,
                       virtual noise is enabled. (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Transmitter referred   The TXREFVNds table defines the downstream transmitter referred
virtual noise          virtual noise. TXREFVNds is specified through a set of breakpoints.
downstream table:      Each breakpoint comprises a subcarrier index t, with a subcarrier spacing
                       of 4.3125 kHz, and a noise PSD level at that subcarrier. The set of
                       breakpoints can then be represented as [(t1, PSD1), (t2, PSD2), … ,
                       (tN, PSDN)]. The subcarrier index t is an unsigned two-byte integer. The
                       noise level is one byte whose value ranges from 0 (–40 dBm/Hz) to 200
                       (–140 dBm/Hz), in steps of 0.5 dB. Values between 201 and 254 indicate

table:                 Each breakpoint comprises a subcarrier index t, with a subcarrier spacing
                       of 4.3125 kHz, and a noise PSD level at that subcarrier. The set of
                       breakpoints can then be represented as [(t1, PSD1), (t2, PSD2), … ,
                       (tN, PSDN)]. The subcarrier index t is an unsigned two-byte integer. The
                       noise level is one byte whose value ranges from 0 (–40 dBm/Hz) to 200
                       (–140 dBm/Hz), in steps of 0.5 dB. Values between 201 and 254 indicate
                       a noise PSD level of 0 W/Hz. The maximum number of breakpoints
                       is 16.
                       Table entries for this attribute have default value 254 for the noise PSD

                                   (255.5 dB) in steps of 0.5 dB. The value 0 has the special meaning that it
