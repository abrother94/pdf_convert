9.4.6   IP router performance monitoring history data 1
This managed entity collects some of the IP-related performance monitoring data at an IP router.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of the IP router service profile.
Attributes
Managed entity id:        This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed entity.
                          Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly linked to an
                          instance of the IP router service profile. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory)
                          (2 bytes)
Interval end time:        This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute interval. (R)
                          (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:    This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 and 2 managed
                          entities that contains PM threshold values. (R, W, Set-by-create)
                          (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Ip in receives counter:   This attribute counts packets received from interfaces, including those with
                          errors. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Ip in hdr errors          This attribute counts packets discarded due to errors in their IP headers,
counter:                  including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format errors,
                          time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing IP options, etc. (R)
                          (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Ip in addr errors         This attribute counts packets discarded because their destination IP
counter:                  addresses were not valid for this router. This includes invalid addresses
                          (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported classes (e.g., class E). (R)
                          (mandatory) (4 bytes)
                             as a result of which an attempt was made to forward them. (R) (mandatory)
                             (4 bytes)
Ip in unknown protos         This attribute counts packets that were locally destined and received
counter:                     successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported
                             protocol. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Ip in discards counter:  This attribute counts input packets for which no problems were
                             encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were
                             nevertheless discarded, e.g., for lack of buffer space. It does not include
                             packets discarded while awaiting re-assembly. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Ip in delivers counter:      This attribute counts input packets successfully delivered to local IP
                             application protocols, including ICMP. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Ip out requests counter:  This attribute counts packets originated by local IP application protocols,
                             including ICMP. This does not include packets counted in ip forw packets
                             counter. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Ip out discards counter:  This attribute counts output packets for which no problem was
                             encountered to prevent transmission to their destination, but which were
                             nevertheless discarded, e.g., for lack of buffer space. It includes packets
                             counted in ip forw packets counter if any such packets met this discard
                             criterion. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Ip out no routes             This attribute counts packets discarded because no forwarding route was
counter:                     available. It includes any packets counted in ip forw packets counter that
                             met this no-route criterion. It also includes packets that a host could not
                             route because all of its default gateways were down. (R) (mandatory)
                             (4 bytes)
