9.3.9   MAC bridge port performance monitoring history data
This managed entity collects performance monitoring data associated with a MAC bridge port.
Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
For a complete discussion of generic PM architecture, refer to clause I.1.9.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of a MAC bridge port
configuration data managed entity.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                linked to an instance of the MAC bridge port configuration data
                                ME. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Interval end time:              This attribute identifies the most recently finished 15-minute
                                interval. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
Threshold data 1/2 id:          This attribute points to an instance of the threshold data 1 managed
                                entity that contains PM threshold values. Since no threshold value
                                attribute number exceeds 7, a threshold data 2 ME is optional.
                                (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Forwarded frame counter:        This attribute counts frames transmitted successfully on this port.
                                (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
Delay exceeded discard          This attribute counts frames discarded on this port because
counter:                        transmission was delayed. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
MTU exceeded discard            This attribute counts frames discarded on this port because the
counter:                        MTU was exceeded. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
                                  (4 bytes)
Received and discarded            This attribute counts frames received on this port that were
counter:                          discarded due to errors. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
