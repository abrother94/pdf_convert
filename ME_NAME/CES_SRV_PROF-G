9.8.3    CES service profile-G
NOTE – Except for its name, this managed entity is substantially identical to the CES service profileB-PON
defined in [ITU-T G.983.2].
An instance of this managed entity organizes data that describe the CES service functions of the
ONT. Instances of this managed entity are created and deleted by the OLT.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity may be associated with zero or more instances of an
interworking termination point.
Attributes
Managed entity id:            This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                              entity. (R, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
CES buffered CDV              This attribute represents the duration of user data that must be
tolerance:                    buffered by the CES interworking entity to offset packet delay
                              variation. It is expressed in 10 microsecond increments. The default
                              value for DS1 CES is 750 μs; for DS3 CES, it is 1000 μs. (R, W, Set-by-create) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
Channel associated            This attribute selects the signalling format. It applies to structured
signalling:                   interfaces only. For unstructured interfaces, this value, if present,
                              must be set to the default 0. Valid values are:
                              0    Basic.
                              1    E1 CAS.
                              2    SF CAS.
