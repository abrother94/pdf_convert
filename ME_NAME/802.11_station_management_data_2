9.6.3    802.11 station management data 2
This managed entity organizes some of the data associated with an 802.11 station. The ONT
automatically creates an instance of this entity whenever it creates a PPTP 802.11 UNI instance.
Relationships
An instance of this managed entity is associated with an instance of an [IEEE 802.11] interface.
Attributes
Managed entity id:                  This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                    entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                    linked to an instance of the physical path termination point
                                    802.11 UNI. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 disassociate reason:          This attribute records the reason code in the most recently
                                    transmitted disassociation frame. If no disassociation frame has
                                    been transmitted, the value of this attribute is 0. (R)
                                    (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 disassociate station:         This attribute records the MAC address from the address 1 field
                                    of the most recently transmitted disassociation frame. If no
                                    disassociation frame has been transmitted, the value of this
                                    attribute is 0. (R) (mandatory) (6 bytes)
dot11 deauthenticate reason:        This attribute records the reason code in the most recently
                                    transmitted deauthentication frame. If no deauthentication frame
                                    has been transmitted, the value of this attribute is 0. (R)
                                    (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 deauthenticate station:       This attribute records the MAC address from the address 1 field
                                    of the most recently transmitted deauthentication frame. If no
                                    deauthentication frame has been transmitted, the value of this
                                    attribute is 0. (R) (mandatory) (6 bytes)
                                  transmitted failed authentication frame. If no failed
                                  authentication frame has been transmitted, the value of this
                                  attribute is 0. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
dot11 authenticate fail station:  This attribute records the MAC address from the address 1 field
                                  of the most recently transmitted failed authentication frame. If
                                  no failed authentication frame has been transmitted, the value of
                                  this attribute is 0. (R) (mandatory) (6 bytes)
                                  The four following attributes contain WEP default keys 1..4,
                                  respectively. For security, WEP default secret keys are write-
                                  only. The default value of each WEP default key is 0.
dot11 WEP default key value1:     (W) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
dot11 WEP default key value2:     (W) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
dot11 WEP default key value3:     (W) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
dot11 WEP default key value4:     (W) (mandatory) (5 bytes)
dot11 privacy invoked and dot11 This attribute specifies two truth values. It is coded
exclude unencrypted:              0b0000 00yx, where x indicates the dot11 privacy invoked
                                  value, and y indicates the dot11 exclude unencrypted value.
                                  When dot11 privacy invoked is true, [IEEE 802.11] WEP is
                                  used for transmitting data frames. The default value of this
                                  attribute is false.
                                  When dot11 exclude unencrypted is true, the STA does not
                                  indicate received MSDUs whose WEP subfield of the frame
                                  control field is 0 at the MAC service interface. When this value
                                  is false, the STA may accept MSDUs whose WEP subfield of
                                  the frame control field is 0. The default value of this attribute is
                                  false.
                                  (R, W) (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 WEP default key ID:         When set to values of 0..3, this attribute specifies use of WEP
                                  default key 1..4, respectively. The default value is 0. (R, W)
                                  (mandatory) (1 byte)
dot11 WEP key mapping length: The maximum number of tuples that dot11 WEP key mappings
                                  can hold. Dot11 WEP key mappings are contained in the 802.11
                                  general purpose object ME, object type 0. (R, W) (mandatory)
                                  (4 bytes)
dot11 WEP ICV error count:        This counter increments when a frame is received whose frame
                                  control field, WEP subfield, is 1, and whose received ICV does
                                  not match the ICV value calculated for the frame's contents. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
dot11 WEP excluded count:         This counter increments when a frame is received whose WEP
                                  subfield of the frame control field is 0, and the value of dot11
                                  exclude unencrypted causes that frame to be discarded. (R)
                                  (mandatory) (4 bytes)
