9.7.16 VDSL2 line inventory and status data part 1
This managed entity extends the other xDSL line inventory and status data MEs with attributes
specific to VDSL2. This ME contains general and downstream attributes.
Relationships
This is one of the status data MEs pointed to by a physical path termination point xDSL managed
entity. It is required only if VDSL2 is supported by the PPTP. The ONT automatically creates or
deletes an instance of this managed entity upon creation and deletion of a physical path termination
point xDSL that supports these attributes.
Attributes
Managed entity id:              This attribute uniquely identifies each instance of this managed
                                entity. Through an identical ID, this managed entity is implicitly
                                linked to an instance of the physical path termination point xDSL
                                managed entity. (R) (mandatory) (2 bytes)
                                VDSL2 transmission system This attribute extends the xTU-C transmission system capability
capability xTU-C:               attribute of the xDSL line inventory and status data part 1 to include
                                xTU-C VDSL2 capabilities. It is defined by bits 57..64 of
                                Table 9.7.12-1. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
VDSL2 transmission system: This attribute reports the transmission system in use. It extends the
                                xDSL transmission system attribute of the xDSL line inventory and
                                status data part 2 managed entity with a byte that includes VDSL2
                                capabilities currently in use. It is defined by bits 57..64 of
                                Table 9.7.12-1. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                         allowed, 1 if allowed) with the following definition:
                         Bit           Meaning
                         1 (LSB)       G.993.2 profile 8a.
                         2             G.993.2 profile 8b.
                         3             G.993.2 profile 8c.

                         (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                         VDSL2 limit PSD mask and This attribute defines the limit PSD mask and band plan in use. It is a
bandplan:                bit map as defined by Table 9.7.6-1. (R) (mandatory) (8 bytes)
VDSL2 US0 PSD mask:      This attribute defines the US0 PSD mask in use. It is a bit map as
                         defined by Table 9.7.6-2. (R) (mandatory) (4 bytes)
ACTSNRMODEds:            This attribute indicates whether transmitter referred virtual noise is
                         active on the line in the downstream direction.
                         1   Virtual noise inactive.
                         2   Virtual noise active.
                         (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
                         The following four attributes have similar definitions. In each case,
                         valid attribute values are 1, 2, 4, 8. In ADSL applications, the
                         corresponding value is fixed at 1, and therefore need not be
                         specified. For VDSL2, it is equal to the size of the subcarrier group
                         used to compute these attributes (see clause 11.4.1 of
                         [ITU-T G.993.2]).
HLINGds:                 This attribute contains the number of subcarriers per group used to
                         report HLINpsds. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
HLOGGds:                 This attribute contains the number of subcarriers per group used to
                         report HLOGpsds. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
QLNGds:                  This attribute contains the number of subcarriers per group used to
                         report QLNpsds. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
SNRGds:                  This attribute contains the number of subcarriers per group used to
                         report SNRpsds. (R) (mandatory) (1 byte)
MREFPSDds table:         The downstream medley reference PSD table contains the set of
                         breakpoints exchanged in the MREFPSDds fields of the O-PRM
                         message of [ITU-T G.993.2].
                         The format is similar to that specified for the PSD descriptor in
                         [ITU-T G.993.2]. In [ITU-T G.993.2], the first byte gives the size of
                         the table, each entry of which is three bytes. In the OMCI definition,
                         the first byte is omitted, because the size of the table is known from
                         the response to the get command.
                         (R) (mandatory) (3N bytes, where N is the number of breakpoints)
                                downstream direction.
                                0 Trellis not used.
                                1 Trellis used.
                                (R) (mandatory for [ITU-T G.993.2] VDSL2, optional for others)
                                (1 byte)
